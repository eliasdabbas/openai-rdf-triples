but temporary break from an internationalism that had defined seven decades of U.S. interactions with the world. He saw little value in alliances and spurned multilateral institutions. He eagerly withdrew from existing international agreements, such as the Paris climate accord and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and backed away from new ones, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). He coddled autocrats and trained his ire on the United States\u2019 democratic partners. At first glance, the foreign policy of U.S. President Joe Biden could hardly be more different. He professes to value the United States\u2019 traditional allies in Europe and Asia, celebrates multilateralism, and hails his administration\u2019s commitment to a \u201crules-based international order.\u201d He treats climate change as a serious threat and arms control as an essential tool. He sees the fight of our time as one between democracy and autocracy, pledging to convene what he is calling the Summit for Democracy to reestablish U.S. leadership in the democratic cause. \u201cAmerica is back,\u201d he proclaimed shortly after taking office. But the differences, meaningful as they are, obscure a deeper truth: there is far more continuity between the foreign policy of the current president and that of the former president than is typically recognized. Critical elements of this continuity arose even before Trump\u2019s presidency, during the administration of Barack Obama, suggesting a longer-term development\u2014a paradigm shift in the United States\u2019 approach to the world. Beneath the apparent volatility, the outlines of a post\u2013post\u2013Cold War U.S. foreign policy are emerging. The old foreign policy paradigm grew out of  World War II  and the Cold War, founded on the recognition that U.S. national security depended on more than just looking out for the country\u2019s own narrowly defined concerns. Protecting and advancing U.S. interests, both domestic and international, required helping shepherd into existence and then sustaining an international system that, however imperfect, would buttress U.S. security and prosperity over the long term. Despite missteps (above all, the misguided attempt to reunify the Korean Peninsula by force and the war in Vietnam), the results largely validated these assumptions. The United States avoided a great-power war with the Soviet Union but still ended the Cold War on immensely favorable terms; U.S. GDP has increased eightfold in real terms and more than 90-fold in nominal terms since the end of World War II. The new paradigm dismisses the core tenet of that approach: that the United States has a vital stake in a broader global system, one that at times demands undertaking difficult military interventions or putting aside immediate national preferences in favor of principles and arrangements that bring long-term benefits. The new consensus reflects not an across-the-board  isolationism \u2014after all, a hawkish approach to China is hardly isolationist\u2014but rather the rejection of that internationalism. Today, notwithstanding Biden\u2019s pledge \u201cto help lead the world toward a more peaceful, prosperous future for all people,\u201d the reality is that Americans want the benefits of international order without doing the hard work of building and maintaining it. The hold of this emerging nationalist approach to the world is clear, accounting for the continuity across administrations as different as those of Obama, Trump, and Biden. Whether it can produce a foreign policy that advances American security, prosperity, and values is another matter entirely. As with any paradigm shift, the one taking place now is possible only because of the failures\u2014both real and perceived\u2014of much of what came in the years before. The Cold War ended 30 years ago, and the United States emerged from that four-decade struggle with a degree of primacy that had few, if any, historical precedents. U.S. power was immense in both absolute and relative terms. It may have been an exaggeration to hail a \u201cunipolar moment,\u201d but not by much. Historians who look back on these three decades will be rightly critical of a lot that the United States did, and did not do, with its position. There were some important accomplishments: the reunification of Germany within NATO, the disciplined handling of the 1990\u201391 Gulf War, the U.S.-led military and diplomatic effort to help end the war and slaughter in the former Yugoslavia, the fashioning of new trade agreements, the millions of lives saved thanks to the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR. But these achievements must be weighed against American failures, both of commission and omission. Washington managed little in the way of relationship and institution building, lacking the creativity and ambition that characterized U.S. foreign policy in the wake of World War II. It wasn\u2019t considered much of a stretch when Dean Acheson, who was secretary of state during the Truman administration, titled his memoir  Present at the Creation ; no recent secretary of state could credibly include the word \u201ccreation\u201d in his or her memoir. Despite its unmatched power, the United States did little to address the widening gap between global challenges and the institutions meant to contend with them. The list of missteps is long. Washington largely failed to adapt to China\u2019s rise. Its decision to enlarge NATO, in violation of Churchill\u2019s dictum \u201cIn victory, magnanimity,\u201d fanned Russian hostility without sufficiently modernizing or strengthening the alliance. Africa and Latin America received only intermittent, and even then limited, attention. Above all, the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were failures of both design and execution, resulting in costly overreach, part of a broader U.S. focus on the greater Middle East that defied strategic logic. The George W. Bush and Obama administrations dedicated a high percentage of their foreign policy focus to a region home to only about five percent of the world\u2019s population, no great powers, and economies dependent on the wasting asset of fossil fuels.\u00a0 The word that comes to mind in assessing U.S. foreign policy after the Cold War is \u201csquander.\u201d The United States missed its best chance to update the system that had successfully waged the Cold War for a new era defined by new challenges and new rivalries. Meanwhile, thanks to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the American public largely soured on what was widely seen as a costly, failed foreign policy. Americans came to blame trade for the disappearance of millions of manufacturing jobs (despite new technologies being the main culprit), and growing inequality, exacerbated by both the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic, fueled populist suspicion of elites. In the face of looming domestic problems, including decaying infrastructure and faltering public education, foreign involvement came to be viewed as a costly distraction. The stage for a new foreign policy paradigm was set. The first and most prominent element of continuity between Trump and Biden is the centrality of great-power rivalry\u2014 above all, with China . Indeed, U.S. policy toward China has hardly changed since Biden became president: as Matthew Pottinger, a senior official on the National Security Council during the Trump administration who was the lead architect of that administration\u2019s approach to China, rightly noted  in these pages , \u201cThe Biden administration has largely maintained its predecessor\u2019s policy.\u201d Biden himself has spoken of \u201cextreme competition\u201d with China, and his coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs has proclaimed that \u201cthe period that was broadly described as engagement has come to an end.\u201d This new posture reflects the pervasive disillusionment in the American foreign policy establishment with the results of efforts to integrate China into the world economy and the broader international system, along with heightened concern about how Beijing is using its growing strength abroad and engaging in repression at home. The continuity between the two administrations can be seen in their approaches to Taiwan, the most likely flash point between the United States and China. Far from rescinding a policy introduced in the final weeks of the Trump administration that removed restrictions on official U.S. interactions with Taiwanese officials, the Biden administration has actively implemented it, publicizing high-level meetings between U.S. officials and their Taiwanese counterparts. Just as the Trump administration worked to improve U.S.-Taiwanese ties, the Biden administration has repeatedly stressed its \u201crock solid\u201d support for Taiwan and has inserted language emphasizing the importance of cross-strait stability into joint statements not just with Asian allies, such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea, but also with global bodies, such as the G-7.\u00a0 Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a Quad meeting in Washington, D.C., September 2021   Evelyn Hockstein / Reuters   The continuity goes beyond Taiwan. The Biden administration has kept in place Trump-era tariffs and export controls and is reportedly looking into launching an investigation into China\u2019s large-scale industrial subsidies. It has doubled down on criticism of China\u2019s refusal to allow an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19 and given credence to the possibility that the new coronavirus leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. Like its predecessor, it has called Beijing\u2019s repression of the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang a \u201cgenocide\u201d and denounced its violation of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle in Hong Kong. It has strengthened efforts to upgrade the Quad, a dialogue meant to enhance cooperation among Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, and launched a complementary strategic initiative with Australia and the United Kingdom. It has also continued to use the term \u201cIndo-Pacific,\u201d first brought into common official usage by the Trump administration. To be sure, there are differences in the Biden administration\u2019s approach in some important areas, including a focus on finding ways to cooperate on climate change, the decision to refrain from echoing the call by Trump\u2019s secretary of state Mike Pompeo for regime change in Beijing, and an effort to build a common stance with allies. Yet the view that China is the United States\u2019 chief competitor and even adversary has become widespread and ingrained, and the similarities in the two administrations\u2019 approaches far outweigh any differences. Much the same can be said of the administrations\u2019 policies toward the United States\u2019 other great-power competitor. Since Biden took over, U.S. policy toward Russia has changed little in substance. Gone is Trump\u2019s inexplicable admiration for  Russian President Vladimir Putin . But whatever Trump\u2019s personal regard for Putin, the Trump administration\u2019s posture toward Russia was in fact fairly tough. It introduced new sanctions, closed Russian consulates in the United States, and enhanced and expanded U.S. military support to Ukraine\u2014all of which has continued under Biden. The common view between the two administrations seems to be that U.S. policy toward Russia should mostly consist of damage limitation\u2014preventing tensions, whether in Europe or in cyberspace, from deteriorating into a crisis. Even Biden\u2019s willingness to extend U.S.-Russian arms control pacts and start \u201cstrategic stability\u201d talks is mostly about preventing additional erosion, not making further progress. The days of seeking a \u201creset\u201d with Moscow are long gone. Accompanying this focus on great powers is a shared embrace of American  nationalism . The Trump administration eagerly adopted the slogan and idea of \u201c America first ,\u201d despite the label\u2019s origins in a strand of isolationism tinged with sympathy for Nazi Germany. The Biden administration is less overt in its nationalism, but its mantra of \u201ca foreign policy for the middle class\u201d reflects some similar inclinations. \u00a0\u201cAmerica first\u201d tendencies also characterized the Biden administration\u2019s initial response to COVID-19. U.S. exports of vaccines were limited and delayed even as domestic supply far exceeded demand, and there has been only a modest effort to expand manufacturing capacity to allow for greater exports. This domestic focus was shortsighted, as highly contagious variants were able to emerge in other parts of the world before coming to do immense damage in the United States. It also forfeited an opportunity to cultivate goodwill internationally by demonstrating the superiority of American technology and generosity in the face of Chinese and Russian vaccine diplomacy.\u00a0 U.S. trade policy has been shaped by similar forces, demonstrating further continuity between Trump and Biden. The latter has avoided the hyperbole of the former, who savaged all trade pacts except for the ones his own administration had negotiated. (No matter that the Trump administration\u2019s agreements were mostly updated versions of existing pacts: the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, for example, largely followed the much-denounced North American Free Trade Agreement and, in modernizing certain elements, made generous use of the text of the equally denounced TPP.) But the Biden administration has shown little, if any, interest in strengthening the World Trade Organization, negotiating new trade accords, or joining existing ones, including the successor agreement to the TPP, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP, despite the overwhelming economic and strategic reasons for doing so. Staying outside the agreement leaves the United States on the sidelines of  the Indo-Pacific economic order  and also means missing opportunities in other areas, such as advancing global climate goals through cross-border carbon taxes or using the deal to provide an economic counterweight to China. Central to the new foreign policy is the desire to pull back from the greater Middle East, the venue of the so-called forever wars that did so much to fuel this paradigm shift in U.S. foreign policy. Afghanistan is the most striking example of this shared impetus. In February 2020, the Trump administration signed an accord with the Taliban that set a May 1, 2021, deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country. The negotiations cut out and undercut the government of Afghanistan, and the agreement itself failed to call for the Taliban to lay down their arms or even to commit to a cease-fire. It was not so much a peace agreement as a pact to facilitate American military withdrawal. By the time Biden assumed the presidency, the overreach that had once characterized U.S. strategy in Afghanistan was a thing of the past. U.S. troop levels, which had hit 100,000 during the Obama administration, were down to under 3,000, with their role largely limited to training, advising, and supporting Afghan forces. U.S. combat fatalities had plummeted with the end of combat operations in 2014 (years before the U.S.-Taliban accord). The modest U.S. presence provided an anchor for some 7,000 troops from allied countries (and an even larger number of contractors) and a psychological and military backstop for the Afghan government\u2014a sufficient presence, that is, to avert Kabul\u2019s collapse, but not enough to achieve victory or peace. After 20 years, the United States seemed to have found a level of commitment in Afghanistan commensurate with the stakes. Yet the Biden administration rejected the options of renegotiating or scrapping the accord. Instead, it honored Trump\u2019s agreement in every way but one: the deadline for a full U.S. military withdrawal was extended by some 100 days, to September 11, 2021 (and then the withdrawal was completed ahead of schedule). Biden rejected tying the removal of U.S. troops to conditions on the ground or to additional Taliban actions. Like Trump before him, he considered the war in Afghanistan a \u201cforever war,\u201d one he was determined to get out of at any cost. And Biden didn\u2019t just implement the Trump policy he had inherited; his administration did so in a Trumpian way, consulting minimally with others and leaving NATO allies to scramble. (Other decisions, including supplanting French sales of submarines to Australia or being slow to lift COVID-related restrictions against European visitors to the United States, have likewise set back transatlantic ties.) Multilateralism and an alliance-first foreign policy in principle gave way to America-first unilateralism in practice. In the rest of the greater Middle East, the Biden administration has similarly continued the Trump approach of reducing the U.S. footprint. It has resisted any temptation to get more involved in Syria, much less Libya or Yemen; announced it will maintain only a small, noncombat military presence in Iraq; embraced the Abraham Accords while participating only reluctantly in diplomatic efforts to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas; and eschewed launching any new attempt to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.\u00a0 At first glance, Iran may seem like a glaring exception to the broader similarity. Trump was a fierce critic of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran (negotiated when Biden was vice president) and unilaterally exited the accord in 2018; by contrast, the Biden administration (which is staffed at the senior level by several officials who had a large hand in negotiating the pact) has made clear its desire to return to the agreement. But restoring the deal has proved easier said than done, as the two governments have been unable to agree on either specific obligations or sequencing. In addition, a new hard-line Iranian government has shown no interest in signing on to the sort of \u201clonger and stronger\u201d pact the Biden administration seeks. As a result, the Biden administration may well face the same choices its predecessor did, with Iran advancing its nuclear and missile capabilities and its influence throughout the region. Even if Iran once again accepts time-limited constraints on its nuclear activities, the United States will still have to decide how to respond to other Iranian provocations.\u00a0 Even on those issues on which Biden\u2019s rhetoric starkly differs from Trump\u2019s, the policy shifts have been more modest than might have been expected. Consider the two presidents\u2019 views on the role of values in foreign policy. Trump was a  transactional leader  who often seemed to consider democracy a hindrance and tried to establish close personal relationships with many of the world\u2019s dictators. He lavished praise on Putin and exchanged \u201clove letters\u201d with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un. He spoke highly of China\u2019s  Xi Jinping , Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban, while denigrating the leaders of democratic allies, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He even levied tariffs on Canada and the European Union.\u00a0 Biden, by contrast, has declared that the United States is in \u201ca contest with autocrats,\u201d announced plans to hold his Summit for Democracy, and pledged to prioritize relations with countries that share American values. Yet such commitments, however sincere, have hardly made human rights and democracy promotion a more prominent part of U.S. foreign policy. Well-warranted expressions of outrage have not led to significant changes in behavior by others; the targets of such outrage are generally willing and able to absorb U.S. criticism and increasingly even U.S. sanctions, thanks to the growth of alternative sources of support. Myanmar in the wake of a military coup is a textbook example: the United States sanctioned members of the regime, but Chinese largess and diplomatic support have helped the military weather the sanctions. Washington has offered only a minimal response to incidents such as the Cuban government\u2019s brutal reaction to protests last summer or the assassination of Haiti\u2019s president. Whatever concerns Washington may have about Saudi human rights violations, it\u2019s unlikely that those concerns would prevent cooperation with Riyadh on Iran, Yemen, or Israel if, for example, Saudi Arabia\u2019s leaders showed an interest in joining the Abraham Accords.\u00a0 Waiting to evacuate from Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, August 2021   Victor Mancillal / Handout / Reuters   Of course, U.S. presidents have always allowed professed commitments to human rights and democracy to be set aside when other interests or priorities have come to the fore. The \u201cfree world\u201d of the Cold War was often anything but free. But the broader shift in U.S. foreign policy today, with its stress on both great-power competition and short-term domestic priorities, has made those tradeoffs more frequent and acute. In China\u2019s neighborhood, for example, the Biden administration set aside concerns about human rights violations by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in order to make it easier for the U.S. military to operate in his country, and it has worked to bolster ties with Vietnam, another autocracy ruled by a communist party. With Russia, it signed an arms control accord while overlooking the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny. It has largely ignored the rise of Hindu nationalism in India in favor of stronger ties with the country to balance China. With its poorly executed withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the abandonment of many Afghans most vulnerable to  Taliban  reprisals, Washington further forfeited the high ground: the United States walked away from a project that, for all its flaws and failings, had done much to improve the lives of millions of Afghans, above all women and girls. And of course, the sad reality of the fragile state of democracy in the United States\u2014particularly in the wake of the January 6 insurrection\u2014has further undercut Washington\u2019s ability to promote democratic values abroad. None of this is to say that there are not important areas of difference between the Trump administration and the Biden administration on foreign policy\u2014consider climate change, for example: climate denial has given way to new investments in green technology and infrastructure, the regulation of fossil fuel production and use, and participation in the Paris process. But these areas of difference have rarely taken priority when other issues, many of which reflect more continuity, are at stake. Washington has been unwilling to use trade to advance climate goals, sanction Brazil for its destruction of the Amazon, or make meaningful contributions to help poorer countries shift to green energy. In theory, more continuity in U.S. foreign policy should be a good thing. After all, a great power is unlikely to be effective if its foreign policy lurches from administration to administration in a way that unnerves allies, provides openings to adversaries, confuses voters, and makes impossible any long-term commitment to building global norms and institutions. The problem with the emerging American approach to the world is not an absence of domestic political consensus; to the contrary, there is considerable bipartisanship when it comes to foreign policy. The problem is that the consensus is woefully inadequate, above all in its failure to appreciate just how much developments thousands of miles away affect what happens at home.\u00a0 It is also rife with self-defeating contradictions, especially  when it comes to China . Deterring China will require sustained increases in military spending and a greater willingness to use force (since successful deterrence always requires not just the ability but also the perceived will to act). Many Republicans but few Democrats back the former; few in either party seem ready to sign up for the latter. Both parties favor symbolically upgrading U.S.-Taiwanese relations, even though going too far in that direction has the potential to trigger a costly conflict between the United States and China. As much as the United States sees China as an adversary, Washington still needs Beijing\u2019s support if it is to tackle a host of regional and global challenges, from North Korea and Afghanistan to global health. And while the Biden administration has talked much about its support for alliances, U.S. allies are in many cases unprepared to do what the administration believes is necessary to counter China. Indeed, when it comes to both China and Russia, most U.S. allies resist U.S. calls to limit trade and investment ties in sensitive sectors for geopolitical reasons. A posture does not a policy make. Competing with China is essential, but it cannot provide the organizing principle for American foreign policy in an era  increasingly defined by global challenges , including climate change, pandemic disease, terrorism, proliferation, and online disruption, all of which carry enormous human and economic costs. Imagine that the United States successfully deters China from using aggression against its neighbors, from Taiwan to India and Japan, and in the South China Sea. Better yet, imagine that China even stops stealing U.S. intellectual property and addresses U.S. concerns about its trade practices. Beijing could still frustrate U.S. efforts to tackle global challenges by supporting Iranian and North Korean nuclear ambitions, conducting aggressive cyberattacks, building more coal-fired power plants, and resisting reforms to the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization.\u00a0 The contradictions go on. The war in Afghanistan revealed limits to Americans\u2019 support for nation building, but building up the capacity of friends is essential in much of Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East if the governments in those regions are to become better able to meet local security challenges, a prerequisite for their becoming more democratic and for the United States\u2019 shouldering less of the burden. Participation in trade blocs is desirable not just for economic reasons but also to help rein in China\u2019s unfair trade practices and mitigate climate change. Economic nationalism (especially \u201cBuy America\u201d provisions) sets a precedent that, if others follow, will reduce global trade and work against collaborative approaches to developing and fielding new technologies that could make it easier to  compete with China . And in the Middle East, for all the focus on limiting U.S. involvement, it is not clear how pulling back squares with U.S. commitments to counter an Iran intent on developing its nuclear and missile capabilities and on expanding its regional influence, both directly and through proxies. Even a successful effort to revive the 2015 nuclear deal would not change this reality, given what the agreement does not address and given the sunset provisions for its nuclear restrictions. Whatever the failings of this new paradigm, there is no going back; history does not offer do-overs. Nor should Washington return to a foreign policy that, for much of three decades, largely failed both in what it did and in what it did not do.\u00a0 The starting point for a new internationalism should be a clear recognition that although foreign policy begins at home, it cannot end there. The United States, regardless of its diminished influence and deep domestic divisions, faces a world with both traditional geopolitical threats and new challenges tied to globalization. An American president must seek to fix what ails the United States without neglecting what happens abroad. Greater disarray in the world will make the task to \u201cbuild back better\u201d\u2014or whatever slogan is chosen for domestic renewal\u2014much more difficult, if not impossible. Biden has acknowledged the \u201cfundamental truth of the 21st century . . . that our own success is bound up with others succeeding as well\u201d; the question is whether he can craft and carry out a foreign policy that reflects it. The  United States  also cannot succeed alone. It must work with others, through both formal and informal means, to set international norms and standards and marshal collective action. Such an approach will require the involvement of traditional allies in Europe and Asia, new partners, countries that may need U.S. or international help at home, and nondemocracies. It will require the use of all the instruments of power available to the United States\u2014diplomacy, but also trade, aid, intelligence, and the military. Nor can the United States risk letting unpredictability give it a reputation as unreliable; other states will determine their own actions, especially when it comes to balancing or accommodating China, based in no small part on how dependable and active they believe the United States will be as a partner. In the absence of a new American internationalism, the likely outcome will be a world that is less free, more violent, and less willing or able to tackle common challenges. It is equal parts ironic and dangerous that at a time when the United States is more affected by global developments than ever before, it is less willing to carry out a foreign policy that attempts to shape them.

He saw little value in alliances and spurned multilateral institutions. He eagerly withdrew from existing international agreements, such as the Paris climate accord and the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, and backed away from new ones, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). He coddled autocrats and trained his ire on the United States\u2019 democratic partners.@@At first glance, the foreign policy of U.S. President Joe Biden could hardly be more different. He professes to value the United States\u2019 traditional allies in Europe and Asia, celebrates multilateralism, and hails his administration\u2019s commitment to a \u201crules-based international order.\u201d He treats climate change as a serious threat and arms control as an essential tool. He sees the fight of our time as one between democracy and autocracy, pledging to convene what he is calling the Summit for Democracy to reestablish U.S. leadership in the democratic cause. \u201cAmerica is back,\u201d he proclaimed shortly after taking office.@@But the differences, meaningful as they are, obscure a deeper truth: there is far more continuity between the foreign policy of the current president and that of the former president than is typically recognized. Critical elements of this continuity arose even before Trump\u2019s presidency, during the administration of Barack Obama, suggesting a longer-term development\u2014a paradigm shift in the United States\u2019 approach to the world. Beneath the apparent volatility, the outlines of a post\u2013post\u2013Cold War U.S. foreign policy are emerging.@@The old foreign policy paradigm grew out of @@ and the Cold War, founded on the recognition that U.S. national security depended on more than just looking out for the country\u2019s own narrowly defined concerns. Protecting and advancing U.S. interests, both domestic and international, required helping shepherd into existence and then sustaining an international system that, however imperfect, would buttress U.S. security and prosperity over the long term. Despite missteps (above all, the misguided attempt to reunify the Korean Peninsula by force and the war in Vietnam), the results largely validated these assumptions. The United States avoided a great-power war with the Soviet Union but still ended the Cold War on immensely favorable terms; U.S. GDP has increased eightfold in real terms and more than 90-fold in nominal terms since the end of World War II.@@The new paradigm dismisses the core tenet of that approach: that the United States has a vital stake in a broader global system, one that at times demands undertaking difficult military interventions or putting aside immediate national preferences in favor of principles and arrangements that bring long-term benefits. The new consensus reflects not an across-the-board @@\u2014after all, a hawkish approach to China is hardly isolationist\u2014but rather the rejection of that internationalism. Today, notwithstanding Biden\u2019s pledge \u201cto help lead the world toward a more peaceful, prosperous future for all people,\u201d the reality is that Americans want the benefits of international order without doing the hard work of building and maintaining it.@@The hold of this emerging nationalist approach to the world is clear, accounting for the continuity across administrations as different as those of Obama, Trump, and Biden. Whether it can produce a foreign policy that advances American security, prosperity, and values is another matter entirely.@@As with any paradigm shift, the one taking place now is possible only because of the failures\u2014both real and perceived\u2014of much of what came in the years before. The Cold War ended 30 years ago, and the United States emerged from that four-decade struggle with a degree of primacy that had few, if any, historical precedents. U.S. power was immense in both absolute and relative terms. It may have been an exaggeration to hail a \u201cunipolar moment,\u201d but not by much.@@Historians who look back on these three decades will be rightly critical of a lot that the United States did, and did not do, with its position. There were some important accomplishments: the reunification of Germany within NATO, the disciplined handling of the 1990\u201391 Gulf War, the U.S.-led military and diplomatic effort to help end the war and slaughter in the former Yugoslavia, the fashioning of new trade agreements, the millions of lives saved thanks to the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR.@@But these achievements must be weighed against American failures, both of commission and omission. Washington managed little in the way of relationship and institution building, lacking the creativity and ambition that characterized U.S. foreign policy in the wake of World War II. It wasn\u2019t considered much of a stretch when Dean Acheson, who was secretary of state during the Truman administration, titled his memoir @@; no recent secretary of state could credibly include the word \u201ccreation\u201d in his or her memoir. Despite its unmatched power, the United States did little to address the widening gap between global challenges and the institutions meant to contend with them.@@The list of missteps is long. Washington largely failed to adapt to China\u2019s rise. Its decision to enlarge NATO, in violation of Churchill\u2019s dictum \u201cIn victory, magnanimity,\u201d fanned Russian hostility without sufficiently modernizing or strengthening the alliance. Africa and Latin America received only intermittent, and even then limited, attention. Above all, the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were failures of both design and execution, resulting in costly overreach, part of a broader U.S. focus on the greater Middle East that defied strategic logic. The George W. Bush and Obama administrations dedicated a high percentage of their foreign policy focus to a region home to only about five percent of the world\u2019s population, no great powers, and economies dependent on the wasting asset of fossil fuels.\u00a0@@The word that comes to mind in assessing U.S. foreign policy after the Cold War is \u201csquander.\u201d The United States missed its best chance to update the system that had successfully waged the Cold War for a new era defined by new challenges and new rivalries. Meanwhile, thanks to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the American public largely soured on what was widely seen as a costly, failed foreign policy. Americans came to blame trade for the disappearance of millions of manufacturing jobs (despite new technologies being the main culprit), and growing inequality, exacerbated by both the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic, fueled populist suspicion of elites. In the face of looming domestic problems, including decaying infrastructure and faltering public education, foreign involvement came to be viewed as a costly distraction. The stage for a new foreign policy paradigm was set.@@The first and most prominent element of continuity between Trump and Biden is the centrality of great-power rivalry\u2014@@. Indeed, U.S. policy toward China has hardly changed since Biden became president: as Matthew Pottinger, a senior official on the National Security Council during the Trump administration who was the lead architect of that administration\u2019s approach to China, rightly noted @@, \u201cThe Biden administration has largely maintained its predecessor\u2019s policy.\u201d Biden himself has spoken of \u201cextreme competition\u201d with China, and his coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs has proclaimed that \u201cthe period that was broadly described as engagement has come to an end.\u201d This new posture reflects the pervasive disillusionment in the American foreign policy establishment with the results of efforts to integrate China into the world economy and the broader international system, along with heightened concern about how Beijing is using its growing strength abroad and engaging in repression at home.@@The continuity between the two administrations can be seen in their approaches to Taiwan, the most likely flash point between the United States and China. Far from rescinding a policy introduced in the final weeks of the Trump administration that removed restrictions on official U.S. interactions with Taiwanese officials, the Biden administration has actively implemented it, publicizing high-level meetings between U.S. officials and their Taiwanese counterparts. Just as the Trump administration worked to improve U.S.-Taiwanese ties, the Biden administration has repeatedly stressed its \u201crock solid\u201d support for Taiwan and has inserted language emphasizing the importance of cross-strait stability into joint statements not just with Asian allies, such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea, but also with global bodies, such as the G-7.\u00a0@@The continuity goes beyond Taiwan. The Biden administration has kept in place Trump-era tariffs and export controls and is reportedly looking into launching an investigation into China\u2019s large-scale industrial subsidies. It has doubled down on criticism of China\u2019s refusal to allow an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19 and given credence to the possibility that the new coronavirus leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, China. Like its predecessor, it has called Beijing\u2019s repression of the Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang a \u201cgenocide\u201d and denounced its violation of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle in Hong Kong. It has strengthened efforts to upgrade the Quad, a dialogue meant to enhance cooperation among Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, and launched a complementary strategic initiative with Australia and the United Kingdom. It has also continued to use the term \u201cIndo-Pacific,\u201d first brought into common official usage by the Trump administration.@@To be sure, there are differences in the Biden administration\u2019s approach in some important areas, including a focus on finding ways to cooperate on climate change, the decision to refrain from echoing the call by Trump\u2019s secretary of state Mike Pompeo for regime change in Beijing, and an effort to build a common stance with allies. Yet the view that China is the United States\u2019 chief competitor and even adversary has become widespread and ingrained, and the similarities in the two administrations\u2019 approaches far outweigh any differences.@@Much the same can be said of the administrations\u2019 policies toward the United States\u2019 other great-power competitor. Since Biden took over, U.S. policy toward Russia has changed little in substance. Gone is Trump\u2019s inexplicable admiration for @@. But whatever Trump\u2019s personal regard for Putin, the Trump administration\u2019s posture toward Russia was in fact fairly tough. It introduced new sanctions, closed Russian consulates in the United States, and enhanced and expanded U.S. military support to Ukraine\u2014all of which has continued under Biden. The common view between the two administrations seems to be that U.S. policy toward Russia should mostly consist of damage limitation\u2014preventing tensions, whether in Europe or in cyberspace, from deteriorating into a crisis. Even Biden\u2019s willingness to extend U.S.-Russian arms control pacts and start \u201cstrategic stability\u201d talks is mostly about preventing additional erosion, not making further progress. The days of seeking a \u201creset\u201d with Moscow are long gone.@@Accompanying this focus on great powers is a shared embrace of American @@. The Trump administration eagerly adopted the slogan and idea of \u201c@@,\u201d despite the label\u2019s origins in a strand of isolationism tinged with sympathy for Nazi Germany. The Biden administration is less overt in its nationalism, but its mantra of \u201ca foreign policy for the middle class\u201d reflects some similar inclinations.@@\u00a0\u201cAmerica first\u201d tendencies also characterized the Biden administration\u2019s initial response to COVID-19. U.S. exports of vaccines were limited and delayed even as domestic supply far exceeded demand, and there has been only a modest effort to expand manufacturing capacity to allow for greater exports. This domestic focus was shortsighted, as highly contagious variants were able to emerge in other parts of the world before coming to do immense damage in the United States. It also forfeited an opportunity to cultivate goodwill internationally by demonstrating the superiority of American technology and generosity in the face of Chinese and Russian vaccine diplomacy.\u00a0@@U.S. trade policy has been shaped by similar forces, demonstrating further continuity between Trump and Biden. The latter has avoided the hyperbole of the former, who savaged all trade pacts except for the ones his own administration had negotiated. (No matter that the Trump administration\u2019s agreements were mostly updated versions of existing pacts: the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, for example, largely followed the much-denounced North American Free Trade Agreement and, in modernizing certain elements, made generous use of the text of the equally denounced TPP.) But the Biden administration has shown little, if any, interest in strengthening the World Trade Organization, negotiating new trade accords, or joining existing ones, including the successor agreement to the TPP, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP, despite the overwhelming economic and strategic reasons for doing so. Staying outside the agreement leaves the United States on the sidelines of @@ and also means missing opportunities in other areas, such as advancing global climate goals through cross-border carbon taxes or using the deal to provide an economic counterweight to China.@@Central to the new foreign policy is the desire to pull back from the greater Middle East, the venue of the so-called forever wars that did so much to fuel this paradigm shift in U.S. foreign policy. Afghanistan is the most striking example of this shared impetus. In February 2020, the Trump administration signed an accord with the Taliban that set a May 1, 2021, deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country. The negotiations cut out and undercut the government of Afghanistan, and the agreement itself failed to call for the Taliban to lay down their arms or even to commit to a cease-fire. It was not so much a peace agreement as a pact to facilitate American military withdrawal.@@By the time Biden assumed the presidency, the overreach that had once characterized U.S. strategy in Afghanistan was a thing of the past. U.S. troop levels, which had hit 100,000 during the Obama administration, were down to under 3,000, with their role largely limited to training, advising, and supporting Afghan forces. U.S. combat fatalities had plummeted with the end of combat operations in 2014 (years before the U.S.-Taliban accord). The modest U.S. presence provided an anchor for some 7,000 troops from allied countries (and an even larger number of contractors) and a psychological and military backstop for the Afghan government\u2014a sufficient presence, that is, to avert Kabul\u2019s collapse, but not enough to achieve victory or peace. After 20 years, the United States seemed to have found a level of commitment in Afghanistan commensurate with the stakes.@@Yet the Biden administration rejected the options of renegotiating or scrapping the accord. Instead, it honored Trump\u2019s agreement in every way but one: the deadline for a full U.S. military withdrawal was extended by some 100 days, to September 11, 2021 (and then the withdrawal was completed ahead of schedule). Biden rejected tying the removal of U.S. troops to conditions on the ground or to additional Taliban actions. Like Trump before him, he considered the war in Afghanistan a \u201cforever war,\u201d one he was determined to get out of at any cost. And Biden didn\u2019t just implement the Trump policy he had inherited; his administration did so in a Trumpian way, consulting minimally with others and leaving NATO allies to scramble. (Other decisions, including supplanting French sales of submarines to Australia or being slow to lift COVID-related restrictions against European visitors to the United States, have likewise set back transatlantic ties.) Multilateralism and an alliance-first foreign policy in principle gave way to America-first unilateralism in practice.@@In the rest of the greater Middle East, the Biden administration has similarly continued the Trump approach of reducing the U.S. footprint. It has resisted any temptation to get more involved in Syria, much less Libya or Yemen; announced it will maintain only a small, noncombat military presence in Iraq; embraced the Abraham Accords while participating only reluctantly in diplomatic efforts to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas; and eschewed launching any new attempt to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.\u00a0@@At first glance, Iran may seem like a glaring exception to the broader similarity. Trump was a fierce critic of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran (negotiated when Biden was vice president) and unilaterally exited the accord in 2018; by contrast, the Biden administration (which is staffed at the senior level by several officials who had a large hand in negotiating the pact) has made clear its desire to return to the agreement. But restoring the deal has proved easier said than done, as the two governments have been unable to agree on either specific obligations or sequencing. In addition, a new hard-line Iranian government has shown no interest in signing on to the sort of \u201clonger and stronger\u201d pact the Biden administration seeks. As a result, the Biden administration may well face the same choices its predecessor did, with Iran advancing its nuclear and missile capabilities and its influence throughout the region. Even if Iran once again accepts time-limited constraints on its nuclear activities, the United States will still have to decide how to respond to other Iranian provocations.\u00a0@@Even on those issues on which Biden\u2019s rhetoric starkly differs from Trump\u2019s, the policy shifts have been more modest than might have been expected. Consider the two presidents\u2019 views on the role of values in foreign policy. Trump was a @@ who often seemed to consider democracy a hindrance and tried to establish close personal relationships with many of the world\u2019s dictators. He lavished praise on Putin and exchanged \u201clove letters\u201d with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un. He spoke highly of China\u2019s @@, Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban, while denigrating the leaders of democratic allies, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He even levied tariffs on Canada and the European Union.\u00a0@@Biden, by contrast, has declared that the United States is in \u201ca contest with autocrats,\u201d announced plans to hold his Summit for Democracy, and pledged to prioritize relations with countries that share American values. Yet such commitments, however sincere, have hardly made human rights and democracy promotion a more prominent part of U.S. foreign policy. Well-warranted expressions of outrage have not led to significant changes in behavior by others; the targets of such outrage are generally willing and able to absorb U.S. criticism and increasingly even U.S. sanctions, thanks to the growth of alternative sources of support. Myanmar in the wake of a military coup is a textbook example: the United States sanctioned members of the regime, but Chinese largess and diplomatic support have helped the military weather the sanctions. Washington has offered only a minimal response to incidents such as the Cuban government\u2019s brutal reaction to protests last summer or the assassination of Haiti\u2019s president. Whatever concerns Washington may have about Saudi human rights violations, it\u2019s unlikely that those concerns would prevent cooperation with Riyadh on Iran, Yemen, or Israel if, for example, Saudi Arabia\u2019s leaders showed an interest in joining the Abraham Accords.\u00a0@@Of course, U.S. presidents have always allowed professed commitments to human rights and democracy to be set aside when other interests or priorities have come to the fore. The \u201cfree world\u201d of the Cold War was often anything but free. But the broader shift in U.S. foreign policy today, with its stress on both great-power competition and short-term domestic priorities, has made those tradeoffs more frequent and acute. In China\u2019s neighborhood, for example, the Biden administration set aside concerns about human rights violations by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte in order to make it easier for the U.S. military to operate in his country, and it has worked to bolster ties with Vietnam, another autocracy ruled by a communist party. With Russia, it signed an arms control accord while overlooking the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny. It has largely ignored the rise of Hindu nationalism in India in favor of stronger ties with the country to balance China.@@With its poorly executed withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the abandonment of many Afghans most vulnerable to @@ reprisals, Washington further forfeited the high ground: the United States walked away from a project that, for all its flaws and failings, had done much to improve the lives of millions of Afghans, above all women and girls. And of course, the sad reality of the fragile state of democracy in the United States\u2014particularly in the wake of the January 6 insurrection\u2014has further undercut Washington\u2019s ability to promote democratic values abroad.@@None of this is to say that there are not important areas of difference between the Trump administration and the Biden administration on foreign policy\u2014consider climate change, for example: climate denial has given way to new investments in green technology and infrastructure, the regulation of fossil fuel production and use, and participation in the Paris process. But these areas of difference have rarely taken priority when other issues, many of which reflect more continuity, are at stake. Washington has been unwilling to use trade to advance climate goals, sanction Brazil for its destruction of the Amazon, or make meaningful contributions to help poorer countries shift to green energy.@@In theory, more continuity in U.S. foreign policy should be a good thing. After all, a great power is unlikely to be effective if its foreign policy lurches from administration to administration in a way that unnerves allies, provides openings to adversaries, confuses voters, and makes impossible any long-term commitment to building global norms and institutions. The problem with the emerging American approach to the world is not an absence of domestic political consensus; to the contrary, there is considerable bipartisanship when it comes to foreign policy. The problem is that the consensus is woefully inadequate, above all in its failure to appreciate just how much developments thousands of miles away affect what happens at home.\u00a0@@It is also rife with self-defeating contradictions, especially @@. Deterring China will require sustained increases in military spending and a greater willingness to use force (since successful deterrence always requires not just the ability but also the perceived will to act). Many Republicans but few Democrats back the former; few in either party seem ready to sign up for the latter. Both parties favor symbolically upgrading U.S.-Taiwanese relations, even though going too far in that direction has the potential to trigger a costly conflict between the United States and China. As much as the United States sees China as an adversary, Washington still needs Beijing\u2019s support if it is to tackle a host of regional and global challenges, from North Korea and Afghanistan to global health. And while the Biden administration has talked much about its support for alliances, U.S. allies are in many cases unprepared to do what the administration believes is necessary to counter China.

pandemic has exposed massive inequality in everything from health care to food security. The need for visionary moral leadership has never been more acute. Yet business schools\u2014the institutions responsible for producing many members of the next generation of leaders\u2014are not keeping pace. Outside the walls of academia, the idea that maximizing shareholder wealth should be a company\u2019s top priority is no longer sacrosanct, or even widely accepted. And although companies may not always practice what they preach, one powerful sign of this came in 2019, when 181 CEO members of the Business Roundtable\u2014one of the leading corporate lobby groups in the United States\u2014pledged to run their companies for the benefit of all stakeholders. Meanwhile, critics of the short-termism that stands in the way of more sustainable forms of capitalism include the leaders of some of the world\u2019s biggest banking and investment institutions, including JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Jamie Dimon, the investor Warren Buffett, and Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, a giant firm with more than $9 trillion in assets under management. At the majority of elite business schools, however, this shift has barely begun. Although the mission statements of most M.B.A. programs pledge to educate leaders who can \u201cmake a difference\u201d or \u201cchange the world,\u201d too many professors remain wedded to a curriculum that largely reinforces the mantra of shareholder primacy without addressing how that approach has contributed to problems such as  massive inequality , the climate crisis, and growing political division. Many schools have introduced courses on sustainability, ethics, climate change, and diversity. Some are publishing cutting-edge research on new sustainable business models and corporate inclusion. Others are embedding the goals of social responsibility and sustainability into their core M.B.A. curricula. Mostly, however, business schools are tinkering around the edges, relegating ideas about social change and moral choice to the margins through optional electives rather than required courses. Meanwhile, the most influential rankings of business schools, such as those published by  U.S. News & World Report  and the  Financial Times , remain largely based on the salaries that students achieve after graduation, reinforcing an ethos that places self-interest above all else. The effects of these shortcomings extend  far beyond  campuses, because some of the biggest problems the world faces today involve the complex intersection of business and society. Thanks to the continuing spread of markets, the rapid advance of technology, and the increasingly interconnected, interdependent quality of global affairs, business leaders find themselves serving not only as executives and investors but also as arbiters of equity, ethics, morality, and social value. That is why the institutions that train them need to impart the insights and moral imagination necessary to  shift away  from models and approaches to business focused on benefiting the few to alternative ones that take into account the common good and the health of the planet. Sustainable development and character building should be included in every aspect of business school curricula, from the core courses to the electives and case studies. Such adjustments will hardly guarantee the kind of change the world needs. But if business schools simply instill in the next generation of business leaders the same value system that they did in past generations, there will be little reason to hope for better from the private sector. Reforming business schools should begin with the most basic questions: Who attends and who teaches? In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests that took place during the spring and summer of 2020, many M.B.A. programs pledged to reckon with systemic racism and inequality, putting forth initiatives to increase the diversity of their student populations. Such efforts are sorely needed, since most business schools continue to recruit almost exclusively from traditional elite institutions and tend to seek out applicants who already have experience in financial services or consulting\u2014sectors that themselves suffer from a lack of diversity. As a result, at most top-rated M.B.A. programs, student cohorts have fewer than one in ten students with work backgrounds primarily in government, education, or the nonprofit sector. Students are also taught by faculties that are disproportionately white. According to the educational nonprofit AACSB International, only around four percent of faculty members at U.S. business schools are people of color. Business schools must massively increase their efforts to address this imbalance and also to attract more students of all races and ethnicities from working-class and lower-income backgrounds. M.B.A. programs should be seeking out not just conventional high achievers and academics but also individuals who have demonstrated resilience and empathy\u2014and who have experienced failure. Another step business schools need to take is developing in students the strength of character to manage profitable businesses while also tackling social problems with imagination, grit, and perseverance. This calls for experiential, immersive learning that puts students in close proximity to people with less privilege or social advantage. In the past, Acumen, the nonprofit venture capital fund that I founded and run, has experimented by surprising team members and fellows participating in the company\u2019s leadership program by taking away their phones and their keys, leaving them with just $5 and a MetroCard, and sending them into low-income communities in New York City, where they spend a day using only those services designed to help the poor\u2014such as soup kitchens and free health clinics. The idea is not pretend that to be poor but to observe city services from the perspective of the people they are meant to serve and then return with ideas on how to redesign those services. Because today\u2019s problems are not confined to one sector or organization, business leaders need the ability to work with a wide variety of stakeholders, from activist nonprofits to government agencies, and with individuals who hold opposing views to theirs. Simulating challenging scenarios in the classroom can help M.B.A. students learn to navigate conflict and collaborate across social and political boundaries. Building businesses that are truly inclusive\u2014and thus able to positively affect inequality\u2014means ensuring that all participants in the value chain can survive and thrive. The supply chains of most multinational organizations heap risks on those who can least afford to take a hit and send rewards almost exclusively to well-insulated asset holders. Consider, for example, the chocolate industry. Around two million smallholder farmers in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Ghana produce over 80 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa. But less than six percent of the price of a typical chocolate bar goes to them, and their average income is just $0.78 per day. There are many initiatives within the chocolate industry to address and monitor some of the problems caused by this inequality of value distribution, but for too long, corporations have sidestepped the work of fixing a broken model by essentially outsourcing the job through large grants to nonprofits and charities. Although charitable work can improve lives, a better way forward would be to reimagine business models and value chains. A British company called Divine Chocolate, for example, gives smallholder cocoa farmers ownership shares; as a result, they receive approximately 44 percent of the company\u2019s profits. These are the kinds of models that business schools should introduce to students, rather than encouraging Band-Aid solutions designed primarily to mitigate reputational risks. Business schools should also make sure their students know how to measure what really matters. Some critics deride the \u201calphabet soup\u201d of acronyms representing methods of measuring the social and environmental impact of business, such as social return on investment (SROI); environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors for investment; and sustainability impact assessments (SIA) for trade. But a successful shift toward sustainable capitalism will require moving away from an exclusive reliance on orthodox measurements of business success, such as shareholder returns, and toward measuring the effects of decisions on all stakeholders. Business schools should be equipping future leaders to understand the tradeoffs that all metrics present and to take a longer view, measuring impacts in terms of years rather than quarters. A final aspect of business school that requires a rethink is the use of case studies. Rather than teaching only cases that highlight traditional business dilemmas and profit-seeking decision-making, business school syllabuses should also include cases that demonstrate complex moral dilemmas and decision-making that takes into account other values and all stakeholders. Everytable, a fast-food startup in Los Angeles, is a good example. They set out to create delicious, healthy food and sell it for less than the traditional fast-food competitors in the \u201cfood deserts\u201d of low-income areas of Los Angeles County. To hit such a competitive price point, they reimagined every aspect of the business model to include centralized kitchens and meal pricing that varies based on a neighborhood\u2019s economic conditions. Everytable\u2019s franchising model includes a training program to support potential franchisees from the communities they serve and provides access to capital through a combination of philanthropy and low-interest loans. This is the kind of enterprise that M.B.A. students ought to be studying: an innovative business using alternative metrics of success and moral imagination to contribute to long-term,  sustainable solutions to poverty . The world of academia moves slowly, and a variety of obstacles would stand in the way of these kinds of changes. For example, business schools might fear putting their students at a disadvantage with recruiters if they stray from the status quo. And schools may experience pushback from professors who have secured tenure based on their expertise in models rooted in shareholder primacy and who might be loath to redesign their courses or adopt new teaching methods. But given the  significant shifts  taking place in business and the investment worlds, as well as in society at large, schools that do not adapt risk becoming irrelevant in the longer term. Change will not happen overnight. Students, alumni, donors, faculty, companies, recruiters, policymakers, and civil society organizations must all push for these kinds of reforms. But with courage, innovation, and resolve, business schools have the opportunity to help usher in the era of sustainable capitalism. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

Most commentators have hailed Powell as a pathbreaker in race relations: the first African American to be national security adviser, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and secretary of state. In these roles, Powell inspired countless people at home and around the world. Most commentators have also noted his role as a reluctant but unfortunately effective salesman for the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Despite his misgivings about some aspects of the policy, Powell accepted the consensus of most of the world\u2019s intelligence services about the nature of Iraq\u2019s alleged weapons of mass destruction, and he mostly agreed with his colleagues in the George W. Bush administration that they represented a threat to be confronted. When he made the case for this confrontation in a memorable speech before the United Nations, and then subsequently learned that most of the intelligence assessments on which that case rested were faulty, it left what he called \u201ca blot\u201d on his record that even he predicted would end up being \u201citem number one\u201d in his obituary. Yet few commentators have emphasized a third important aspect of his legacy: his role in setting the tone for post\u2013Cold War  civil-military relations  in the United States. As with the rest of his legacy, it is a record of considerable consequence: much to be praised and some to be viewed more ambivalently. Powell headed the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1989 to 1993, and he was the most consequential chairman of the modern era.\u00a0He was the first to make full use of the power and prestige that the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 had bestowed upon the position. He converted the Joint Staff from a backwater that was largely ignored during the interservice rivalry of Cold War defense policymaking into a dominant player in the national security interagency process. And he relied on the superior staff work that this organization could produce\u2014as well as his own mastery of bureaucratic politics\u2014to eclipse all other military voices and quite a few civilian voices, too. No chairman before or since has had quite the amount of political clout Powell enjoyed at his apex.\u00a0He was the most popular military officer of his era and might have been the first general since Dwight Eisenhower to win the presidency, had he pursued that office in 1996\u2014as many in the Clinton administration feared he would.\u00a0 Powell helped the country transition from the Cold War to a more confusing era without committing the mistakes that previous generations made by demobilizing and withdrawing from global commitments too extensively.\u00a0He also helped lead a decisive military victory over Iraq during the Gulf War of 1990\u201391, an operation that many look back on wistfully for its restraint and swift execution. As the first and so far only African American to reach the topmost military rank, he personified a renewal of military prestige and inspired the rank and file.\u00a0He played a critical role in helping rebuild public confidence in the military after the trauma of the Vietnam War and the end of the draft. Yet he was also a controversial figure who did not hesitate to use his political acumen to greatly enhance the military\u2019s voice in debates over policy\u2014and constrain the choices of civilian leaders. Powell\u2019s efforts at shaping the post\u2013Cold War defense drawdown centered on what he called \u201cthe Base Force,\u201d a defense planning construct that was designed deliberately to head off what he knew to be a strong desire among many in Congress and within the Clinton administration to make deep cuts in the Pentagon\u2019s budget. Whatever one might think of Powell\u2019s preferred policy, there is no denying that he sought to hem in his civilian superiors and prevent them from making choices they were tempted to make. Similarly, Powell and the service chiefs during his chairmanship opposed the changes that President Bill Clinton proposed to allow gays and lesbians to serve in the military, resulting in the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d compromise that stood from 1993 until its repeal in 2011. During an interview in 2010, Clinton claimed that the DADT policy Powell had \u201csold\u201d him was very different from what ended up being implemented, making the situation for gays and lesbians in the military \u201cworse than it had been before.\u201d In justifying DADT, both Clinton and Powell cited congressional support for an outright ban on gays, but it is hard not to see Powell\u2019s opposition to them serving openly as a pivotal factor. In 2009, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, stated that the main reason he supported DADT was that Powell strongly recommended it. Powell was also influential in shaping the debate over the use of force, which became increasingly important as the so-called Vietnam syndrome receded and the end of the Cold War opened the door to more U.S. military engagements. For many scholars of civil-military relations, Powell\u2019s op-ed in  The New York Times  titled  \u201cWhy Generals Get Nervous,\u201d  published less than four weeks before the 1992 presidential election, remains a textbook example of the ways that a military leader can get caught in the crossfire of a political campaign. In the op-ed, Powell outlined his opposition to Clinton\u2019s proposed uses of the military in Bosnia. He then reiterated his preferred strategy of military restraint in  a  Foreign Affairs  article  that ran just prior to Clinton\u2019s inauguration. His opposition once again proved critical in shaping the policies that were eventually adopted, prompting one former Clinton aide to note, \u201cSo long as Powell didn\u2019t want to bomb, we weren\u2019t going to bomb.\u201d Powell defended his op-ed on the grounds that it had been cleared by the White House while George H. W. Bush was still president and thus still Powell\u2019s civilian commander in chief. But many civil-military specialists have flagged it as the kind of political engagement that the military should avoid, especially during a contentious partisan campaign. The ideas he put forward in his  Foreign Affairs  article, as well as in the 1992 National Military Strategy and later in his autobiography,  My American Journey , became known as \u201cthe Powell Doctrine.\u201d The doctrine rests primarily on a strict test for determining whether military action is the correct course: it must have a clear political objective, be undertaken only if the national interest is at stake, always be a last resort\u2014and, once initiated, employ decisive force. Critics argue that these conditions amount to an unrealistic ideal. The real problem with the Powell Doctrine, however, isn\u2019t its impractical checklist but the fact that it was offered by a general as a way to constrain civilian leaders. As we recently  argued  in these pages, control of the armed forces should not be seen as a binary condition but should be measured in degrees. The Powell Doctrine demonstrates how military judgment\u2014especially when broadcast to the public and not provided to policymakers behind closed doors\u2014can limit and ultimately degrade civilian control. The power that Powell wielded as chairman raises a question that has not been sufficiently answered in the three decades since he retired: Can a senior military leader have the extraordinary political skill that Powell mastered but not overstep by using his acumen to advance the military\u2019s interests over civilian preferences? One answer to this question may be that the country simply hasn\u2019t yet seen the likes of another Powell, so it is hard to be sure. In many ways, Powell\u2019s military career was an anomaly and one that his successors as chairman did not emulate. Powell spent 19 of his final 24 years in uniform in Washington, D.C. His military career path, which included numerous command tours cut short in order to position him for senior positions inside the Beltway, would be unheard of in  today\u2019s U.S. Army , which incentivizes service at the tactical level and in which assignments in Washington are viewed with suspicion. As today\u2019s three- and four-star generals watch the tumult that has marked the chairmanship of General Mark Milley, many may conclude that avoiding politics at all costs remains infinitely preferable to trying to navigate it. In that regard, Powell remains a figure whom many senior officers idolize but whom few appear willing or able to imitate. Still, every chairman since Powell has enjoyed more influence within the interagency process than any Cold War chairman experienced because of the toolkit Powell assembled and left to his successors. Although none has matched him in political clout, each has been asked at some point to speak to the moment in a way that Powell frequently did. Aspects of Powell\u2019s record can be criticized, but one critique that cannot be leveled at him is that he did not matter. He mattered as much as any chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before or since, and today\u2019s generation of military leaders continue to operate if not in his shadow, then at least in his debt.

talks to revive the nuclear agreement that Washington abandoned in 2018, the leadership in Tehran is laying the groundwork for a newly assertive foreign policy. Iran believes Washington has treated the Islamic Republic with deception and disrespect, and it is focused on building economic and military leverage against its longtime antagonist.  Iran\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator recently announced that talks to revive the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, would resume in Vienna before the end of November. Former President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s administration participated in six rounds of negotiations intended to return both sides to \u201cmutual compliance\u201d with the JCPOA. Diplomacy came to a halt, however, after Ebrahim Raisi, a conservative, was inaugurated as Iran\u2019s president in August.  Although the Raisi administration may be willing to participate in negotiations,  the resurrection  of the JCPOA does not constitute a central pillar of its foreign policy. Under the new president, Iran has developed a new nuclear posture that revolves around two principles: enhancing its capability to swiftly retaliate against the United States in case it reneges on its agreements and delinking Iran\u2019s economic fortunes from the JCPOA by building a self-reliant and Asia-focused economy.  As Iran\u2019s nuclear program nears its breakout point, some in Washington are already calling for a \u201cPlan B\u201d of coercive economic measures and threats of the use of force should Tehran refuse to return to full compliance with the nuclear deal. Raisi is already facing massive economic problems at home\u2014with potentially explosive consequences for the  regime \u2014and such measures would aim to pressure him into reviving the JCPOA, which could ameliorate those difficulties. Iran is unlikely to give in to such coercion. Tehran\u2019s conservative leaders were underwhelmed by the benefits supposedly accorded to Iran by the JCPOA and now seek to nurture a sanctions-resistant economy by bolstering its domestic industries and forging new ties with rising powers in Asia. Raisi is also convinced that the United States remains committed to keeping Iran boxed in even if the JCPOA is revived, and he is therefore focused on amplifying Iran\u2019s military and economic leverage to protect not only the Islamic Republic but the broader Shiite Persian nation from what he views as an existential threat.  In Washington, the conversation about Plan B against Iran has been gaining currency. But to the Islamic Republic, Plan B was in fact Plan A from the outset.  FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU The Islamic Republic perceives an asymmetry in the JCPOA\u2019s framework. Iran\u2019s obligations to limit its nuclear activities have clear technical benchmarks verifiable by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). There is no formula, however, that sets out the economic benefits Iran will receive in return from sanctions relief. Additionally, although Tehran faces the quick reimposition of  sanctions  if it leaves the agreement, Washington encountered no serious punishment when it did not honor its end of the bargain.\u00a0  As a result, Iran worries that it could lose its nuclear leverage without obtaining the promised benefits if it returns to full compliance with the JCPOA. This is exactly what happened in 2015, when the deal was announced. Iran rapidly scaled back its nuclear program in accordance with the agreement, shipped 98 percent of its enriched uranium abroad, and accepted enhanced IAEA surveillance. However, international companies and financial institutions still largely stayed away from the Iranian market due to uncertainty about whether the sanctions had been permanently lifted. Their hesitation about doing business with Iran was vindicated after President Donald Trump\u2019s election and his subsequent withdrawal from the JCPOA.  Iran is facing a similar situation again. It fears that its return to full compliance will bring no tangible benefits except inviting more pressure after it gives up its nuclear bargaining chip. U.S. officials say they are willing to discuss ways to address these concerns, but they cannot guarantee that the United States will not withdraw from the agreement again after President Joe Biden leaves office. British, French, and German leaders seemingly tried to assuage Iran\u2019s concerns by lining up behind the agreement in a recent statement at the G-20 summit, saying that they supported Biden\u2019s commitment to maintain full compliance with the agreement \u201cso long as Iran does the same.\u201d   Iran is already signaling its readiness to promptly retaliate against any pressure, sabotage, or attack. U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley has expressed a willingness to \u201c quickly lift all sanctions inconsistent with the JCPOA\u201d if Iran cooperates to restore the agreement.  But for Iranian officials, these kinds of statements are cheap talk\u2014or as Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian described them, \u201cspeech therapy.\u201d Iranian officials question how the Biden administration will determine which sanctions are inconsistent with the nuclear deal. Many of the Trump-era sanctions, after all, were labeled as restrictions imposed due to Iran\u2019s  dismal human rights record  and its support for \u201cterrorist entities\u201d in order to prevent the incoming administration from rejoining the agreement.  The first principle of Raisi\u2019s foreign policy is thus to generate and maintain leverage to disincentivize Washington from reneging on any deal and thus once again causing an economic shock that plunges millions of Iranians into poverty. The Islamic Republic is already signaling its readiness to promptly retaliate against any pressure, sabotage, or attack. For instance,  it has reduced cooperation with the IAEA in protest of the organization\u2019s refusal to condemn the latest assassination of an Iranian nuclear scientist and sabotage against Iran\u2019s monitored facilities, both allegedly done by Israel.  Iran is also focused on bolstering its allies and clients across the Middle East. Three months before his assassination by the United States, General Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, reportedly stated   that he  created  six formidable ideological and popular armies throughout the Middle East to protect Iran from any attacks by its adversaries. According to a senior IRGC commander who recently revealed Soleimani\u2019s statement, these forces  include Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Yemen\u2019s Houthis, pro-Iran Syrian forces, and the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces.  Together, they constitute what Tehran calls the \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d   As Iran expects more pressure from the United States, with or without an agreement, these moves signal its resolve to stay the course. TURNING EAST The Raisi administration\u2019s second principle is to untether the country\u2019s economy from the JCPOA negotiations. Although its predecessor hoped to use the JCPOA as a vehicle to open Iran\u2019s vast market to Western companies, the Raisi team is determined to insulate Iran from the effects of sanctions by enhancing its economic ties with China, Russia, and its neighbors. The new government claims that it is dedicating  40 percent  of its foreign policy activities to economic diplomacy and foreign trade\u2014a departure from the Rouhani administration, which the ruling conservatives assert turned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs into the Ministry of the JCPOA. A revived JCPOA could further facilitate Iran\u2019s economic and security ties with the East, particularly in the aftermath of its recent admission to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. But even without the nuclear deal, Iran sees non-U.S. allies as more reliable business partners. \u00a0 The Raisi administration is also committed to strengthening the capacity of the country\u2019s domestic industries. The president\u2019s team of relatively young economic advisers believes that in response to sanctions, Iranian entrepreneurs have stepped up to manufacture high-quality goods for domestic markets. They are concerned that if sanctions are lifted, major international companies could once again push local manufacturers out of business. In a recent decree, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned the import of home appliances from South Korea. The order was not just retaliation against Seoul\u2019s unpaid $7 billion debt to Iran due to U.S. sanctions; it was also one step in a larger campaign to protect Iranian businesses against an unregulated open-market economy.   With or without the JCPOA, Iran is tying its economic fate to Asia and the Middle East. In addition to moving toward a self-sufficient economy, Iran is now looking to wield greater economic influence in the Middle East, particularly in those countries where it already holds political sway. The Rouhani administration perceived the IRGC\u2019s regional activities as not entirely aligned with Iran\u2019s national interests, but its successor is resolved to demonstrate that the IRGC\u2019s regional power offers tangible political and economic benefits. The government seeks to cash in on the IRGC\u2019s military influence by \u201cinstitutionalizing the achievements of the axis of resistance\u201d in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and beyond, as Amir-Abdollahian has stated.  In response to Lebanon\u2019s ongoing energy crisis, Iran has sent several shipments of fuel products through Syria to be distributed via its ally, Hezbollah. In addition to the promises of more shipments, Amir-Abdollahian has proposed the construction\u00a0of two power plants in Lebanon within 18 months. He has also met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad specifically to discuss Iran\u2019s role in the economic reconstruction of the war-torn nation. It is unclear how Iran can benefit from trading with cash-strapped countries that have their own economic and financial problems. Lebanon and other Arab countries also fear the imposition of U.S. sanctions if they do business with Iran. Nevertheless, Iran\u2019s long-term regional goal is to form a dollar-free economic zone that can resist U.S. economic warfare.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Raisi\u2019s foreign policy team has also worked to appropriate Rouhani\u2019s nonideological reputation. Amir-Abdollahian\u2019s buzzwords are \u201cpragmatism\u201d and \u201cnational interest,\u201d and his position is that Iran is ready to work with any country. Accordingly, the administration is careful not to close any doors to future cooperation: Amir-Abdollahian claimed that  Iran\u2019s economic pivot does not mean \u201cwe are putting aside the West,\u201d pointing to his recent meetings with 18 European foreign ministers during the UN General Assembly in September.  But actions speak louder than words. With or without the JCPOA, Iran is tying its economic fate to Asia and the Middle East.  ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE The Raisi administration\u2019s strategy is based on a fundamental assumption about Iran\u2019s relationship with the United States that the country\u2019s ruling conservative elites have held since the establishment of the Islamic Republic. According to this view, Iran\u2019s size, history, geostrategic location, and economic resources make it a natural regional hegemon and a potential threat to U.S. allies in the Middle East. The United States is therefore determined to keep Iran under economic and military pressure. Consequently, even if there is a nuclear agreement, Washington will undoubtedly find other ways to weaken and isolate Iran. Iranian officials say that this is reflected in the way American and European diplomats negotiate with their Iranian counterparts. According to Amir-Abdollahian, although Iranian negotiators have enough authority to discuss whatever issue is at hand, their counterparts have limited leeway and receive instructions to bring up other matters, such as the IRGC\u2019s regional role and Iran\u2019s missile program.  Iranian officials perceive this as a  tactic  intended not to genuinely resolve any issue but instead to pocket concessions from Iran without reciprocating. In their view, this explains how President George H. W. Bush secured the release of American hostages in Lebanon without honoring his \u201cgoodwill begets goodwill\u201d pledge in the 1990s, how President George W. Bush benefited from Iran\u2019s collaboration to overthrow the Taliban in 2001 only to include Tehran in the \u201caxis of evil\u201d a few months later, and how President Barack Obama lured Iran into the JCPOA without meaningfully removing U.S. sanctions.  Consequently, the Raisi administration expects a new agreement to spark a dramatic increase in the  U.S. pressure campaign  for the precise purpose of denying Iran any tangible benefits from sanctions relief. Iranian officials claim that they are willing to discuss other issues of mutual concern provided the United States agrees to engage on one issue at a time, but they do not foresee any willingness by Washington to accept an agreement that could strengthen the Islamic Republic. Tehran\u2019s strategy is to resist American influence at every turn and respond to coercion with coercion. Even as it prepares to resume negotiations over the nuclear deal, it is setting the stage for all eventualities\u2014including conflict with the United States.

long reluctance to grapple with issues of race, identity, and inequality. Many institutions have failed to direct sufficient attention to these subjects, even as the United States undergoes demographic change, grows more polarized, and continues to treat racial and ethnic minorities in unequal ways. International affairs schools, committed to teaching the next generation of national security leaders, must embrace their responsibility to do better. Too many contemporary international affairs schools provide their students with training that fails to prepare them to tackle fundamental twenty-first-century challenges, such as climate change, intractable conflict, and expanding globalization. Without reform, these schools will leave future foreign policy experts ill prepared to consider how inequities in the United States undercut Washington\u2019s standing and will render them poorly equipped to address the social forces that make societies fragile and fuel unrest worldwide.  To address these challenges,  international affairs  schools   need to  adapt . That means  div ersif y ing  student, faculty, and leadership pipelines ;  incorporat ing  scholarship on diversity, equity, and inclusion into curricul a ;  and  transforming  their campuses  into  inclusive and welcoming  arenas  for  open discussion .   This   comprehensive approach  to international affairs education  will   ensure that  schools value  diversity   and  aspire to   equity   and  also equip students to strengthen U.S. diplomacy and defend  national  security. DIVISION AND NATIONAL SECURITY In the United States, the continued neglect of diversity, equity, and inclusion creates serious national security vulnerabilities. This inattention opens the door to foreign interference,  reduces  Washington\u2019s  influence  abroad,  and limits the effectiveness of U.S. foreign policy. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election, for instance,  Russia  effectively exploited socioeconomic and racial divisions within American society to foment political  discord , contributing to one of the most polarized and contentious electoral contests in U.S. history. \u00a0 The exploitation of these weaknesses by foreign actors continued in 2020, when  China  and Iran joined Russia in  weaponizing  social media to stoke the kinds of resentments and divisions that fueled the January 6  attack  on the U.S. Capitol. The damage that insurrection wrought was not solely domestic; it also led to a flood of criticism from abroad , further reducing  the United States\u2019  global  standing  and diminishing  faith in Washington\u2019s ability to spread democracy around the world.\u00a0  Continued neglect of diversity, equity, and inclusion creates serious national security vulnerabilities. The United States is hardly the only country in which  inequality and exclusion  have profound security implications. Studies link unequally distributed power, wealth, and opportunity to radicalization and unrest. Tensions also tend to rise as countries grow ever more heterogenous, whether through influxes of migrant workers seeking economic opportunity or  record numbers of refugees  fleeing conflict and persecution. Although immigration offers important social and economic benefits\u2014including new sources of  labor for a ging countries  and  security for refugees escaping war \u2014it often provokes political and social tension as societies absorb people of different religions, ethnicities, perspectives, and preferences. \u00a0 Inattention to these demographic trends inhibits societies\u2019 ability to reap the benefits of greater diversity. Promoting inclusion and equity among different groups, for instance, improves stability by increasing social cohesion and augmenting faith in government. Investments that promote equality also pay economic dividends. The full economic empowerment of women around the world, for example, would generate  trillions  of dollars in income and accelerate social, political, and economic progress. Policy interventions designed to address grievances and inequities can also help prevent the outbreak of violence and  reestablish stability  following conflict. \u00a0 A FAILING SYSTEM Despite the centrality of these issues to contemporary international politics, graduate schools of international affairs have failed to keep pace. Conventional curricula often overlook how racial, ethnic, and gender inequality threaten national security and global stability. A 2014  review  of 50 programs offering master\u2019s degrees in public administration programs found that only about ten percent of syllabi touched on issues of gender and culture, and a mere seven percent explored race and ethnicity. International affairs schools also do little to help U.S. foreign-policy makers address the effects of identity, embedded biases, and historical narratives on current events. After the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, for example, Washington would have benefited from greater cultural competency, additional focus on addressing underlying inequities and grievances in both societies, and more inclusive reconstruction and peace-building programs. A lack of institutional diversity within higher education magnifies these problems. Although the  majority of students  in public administration and international affairs programs are women, men still occupy an overwhelming number of faculty and leadership positions, including 60 percent of deanships. Racial and ethnic diversity is also  lacking  among both students and faculty. Women and people of color   are promoted and granted tenure at  lower rates  than their white male counterparts , partly because they face  greater barriers  to getting their research cited and published. Less than 20 percent of deans at international affairs schools are female or people of color. Some schools and institutions have made progress over the past several years. In 2019, for example, the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration strengthened  diversity and inclusion standard s  in the accreditation process for public policy programs. The Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs is now  focused  on increasing the diversity of students embarking on careers in foreign affairs. Multiple universities, including Georgetown, George Washington, Texas A&M, and Tufts, have also created programs that focus on gender or social inclusion. And in 2020, the Harvard Kennedy School  introduced  a two-week mandatory course for incoming students, \u201cRace and Racism in the Making of the United States as a Global Power.\u201d Additionally, a network of deans from public and private schools across the country is helping schools  navigate  similar issues by sharing best practices and recommendations for promoting diversity and inclusion. NO STUDENT LEFT BEHIND Although these efforts are a good start, they still fail to address the  severity of the problem . International affairs programs need to collectively launch a comprehensive examination (led by deans and program directors) of the composition of their faculties, administrations, student bodies, staff, and curricula and the social and political climates on their campuses\u2014taking note of  disparities in compensation, benefits, and financial aid levels.  Schools also should prioritize diversifying faculty and leadership pipelines. Administrators often overlook and undervalue high-potential candidates from diverse backgrounds, as even the most sympathetic evaluators tend to replicate what is already familiar. To remedy this problem, schools should factor diversity, equity, and inclusion concerns into tenure and promotion reviews, as faculty and administrators of diverse backgrounds often bear a  disproportionate responsibility  for supporting and mentoring an increasingly heterogenous student body.  This emphasis on representation should also influence curricula. Courses themselves must consider how diversity, equity, and inclusion impact  global affairs . Classes should address the effect of  U.S. history and contemporary domestic discord on national security and the country\u2019s global reputation . With this goal in mind, professors should revise introductory international relations courses and introduce a new series of required classes. These novel offerings would feature  retooled  syllabi designed to highlight scholarship from diverse experts. Professors could also develop topical seminars meant to discuss the intersection of diversity, equity, and inclusion issues and subtopics in international affairs, such as how identity can underlie violent conflict.  Finally, schools should offer specialization opportunities such as in gender and public policy through concentrations and certification programs.   Schools need to address their own legacies of racism, inequality, and marginalization. Educational institutions must also  foster an inclusive climate that helps students from underrepresented backgrounds thrive.   The  dearth of diversity among foreign affairs professionals  indicates that schools are not successfully cultivating the strongest possible cadre of experts. The United States is weaker for it.   International affairs schools need to engage a wide array of communities, recruit the best candidates early in their education, and offer them promising career paths. To do so, colleges and universities must first address the  racial, gender, and socioeconomic inequalities that persist within academic communities, which the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated. Low-income students are abandoning their studies  at far  higher rates  than their wealthier counterparts, and research and publishing rates among female faculty have  declined  precipitously , as women often assume a disproportionate share of elder- and childcare responsibilities.  Schools also need to address their own legacies of racism, inequality, and marginalization. Georgetown University, for its part, is reckoning with its troubled past through  its slavery, memory, and reconciliation  effort ,  which examines the university\u2019s legacy of slave ownership and trade. Following the murder of George Floyd, the Princeton Board of Trustees decided to drop Woodrow Wilson\u2019s name from both a residential college and the School of Public and International Affairs, stating that the former president\u2019s \u201cracist thinking and policies\u00a0make him an inappropriate namesake for a school or college whose scholars, students, and alumni must stand firmly against racism in all its forms.\u201d \u00a0 A focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion in global affairs is long overdue. The systematic lack of attention that educational institutions have paid to these issues has created vulnerabilities at home and abroad. Only by engaging the academic community can leaders transform the face and shape of U.S. foreign policy to meet the challenges of the   twenty-first century. International affairs schools must undertake a comprehensive effort to revitalize leadership, update curricula, and create an inclusive climate. Such an effort will pay dividends for decades to come.

link Get Citation Request Reprint Permissions The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has made no secret of its  desire  to extricate the United States from the Middle East. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in an interview before taking office, said that he envisioned a Biden presidency would do \u201cless not more\u201d in the region. A senior U.S. official likewise told me that the Obama administration didn\u2019t follow through on its so-called pivot to Asia, but \u201cthis time we are.\u201d  The United States\u2019 \u201c strategic competition \u201d with China currently dominates American foreign policy discussion, representing bipartisan consensus in an otherwise divided Washington. But for all the talk about withdrawing from the Middle East and genuine regional anxiety about U.S. abandonment in the aftermath of Afghanistan, the reality on the ground suggests otherwise: Washington still maintains a sprawling network of military bases and has proved willing to embrace even its most unsavory partners in the name of bolstering regional security. What\u2019s more, regional dynamics are likely to lead to further instability and violence\u2014fueling a demand for a continued American presence. To be sure, the United States is no longer the only global player in the Middle East. Chinese economic and technology investments and Russia\u2019s military influence have grown over the past decade. In that sense, the American moment is over. And yet, much as Americans may like to be done with the Middle East, the Middle East is not done with the United States. American withdrawal is not only a myth, it is preventing an important debate in Washington about how the United States can adjust its policies to improve the lives of the region\u2019s citizens and contribute to a more just political order in the Middle East. BUSINESS AS USUAL For all the fears in Arab capitals of declining American commitment to the Middle East, U.S. military engagement shows more continuity than commonly acknowledged. Despite a promise to review a $23 billion arms sale to the United Arab Emirates with a greater emphasis on human rights, the Biden administration decided to move ahead with the sale. Biden\u2019s \u201crecalibration\u201d of relations with Saudi Arabia has also not led to major policy change: Saudi Defense Minister Khalid bin Salman, brother of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, received high-level meetings with top U.S. officials during a visit to Washington in July, despite the release of a U.S. intelligence report assessing the crown prince approved the operation to capture and kill the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan also met directly with the crown prince in Riyadh in September 2021. The administration subsequently pushed forward a new $650 million arms sale to Saudi Arabia.  This does not look like an administration turning its back on traditional U.S. partners or \u201cputting human rights at the center\u201d of its foreign policy. This pattern extends beyond the United States\u2019 wealthy partners in the Gulf: although the Biden team chose to temporarily withhold $130 million in military aid to Egypt, its decision fell short of human rights organizations\u2019 expectations that the administration would uphold congressional legislation conditioning $300 million in military aid on concrete progress on rule of law and reform measures. With $1.3 billion granted annually through the U.S. Foreign Military Financing program, Egypt remains among the top three recipients of American military aid globally, despite President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\u2019s crackdown on political opposition and civil society. The Biden administration did signal a realignment of its military posture by announcing a reduction of its antimissile systems in the region as it refocused on the challenge posed by Russia and China. The removal of these systems from Saudi Arabia in September, even as the Houthis continued to launch missile attacks on Saudi territory from Yemen, reinforced Riyadh\u2019s sense of abandonment by the United States. The Department of Defense is also currently engaged in a major global force posture review, which will likely impact the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East as the United States prioritizes threats in the Indo-Pacific. But it remains doubtful that a radical reduction of tens of thousands of U.S. troops is on the horizon\u2014or that Washington is prepared to ignore the perceived security needs of its major regional partners.  BASE OF SUPPORT The strategic case for reducing the American presence in the Middle East is straightforward. In addition to the need to shift resources to Asia given changing geostrategic conditions, the United States\u2019 reliance on oil from the Middle East has decreased significantly. There has also been increased scrutiny on whether large bases are effective for counterterrorism missions and whether these bases may provoke further attacks from Iran rather than deter them. Some analysts argue the United States should bring all troops home, while others argue for a more dispersed regional posture utilizing smaller bases. This would make the United States less reliant on large operating bases such as Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar or Camp Arifjan in Kuwait, which may become more vulnerable to Iranian attacks as Tehran\u2019s missile and drone strike capabilities advance.  These arguments are compelling. But political considerations, bureaucratic inertia, the United States\u2019 continued vulnerability to global oil market shocks, and the economic interests of the U.S. defense industry make a swift reversal unlikely\u2014regardless of the strategic logic. The United States\u2019 Gulf partners want American forces to stay, viewing the bases as a sign of Washington\u2019s political commitment to their security. And after Qatar and other Gulf states played such an important role in the airlift of Afghans following the American withdrawal from the country, is the Biden administration likely to close down Al Udeid? A drawdown may be possible, but complete closure is a stretch.   The Middle East is not done with the United States. Continued bipartisan focus on Iran will also work in favor of a considerable American military presence. Joint maritime security exercises, which are conducted with an eye toward containing Iran, now include the United States, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain. It is also unclear whether the large U.S. bases are as exposed to Iranian attacks as some fear: Qatar and Kuwait, countries that host thousands of U.S. personnel, maintain friendlier relations with Tehran and may not be as vulnerable to Iranian attacks on U.S. forces within their countries. The benefits of reducing the American presence in the region therefore may be outweighed by the political costs of alienating Gulf partners.  The rotation of missile defense systems and aircraft carriers out of the Middle East is one sign of the reduced U.S. presence in the region and will likely become more frequent as resources shift to Asia. Regional partners won\u2019t like that, but they will learn to live with it. But shutting down massive military infrastructure is another matter entirely.  THE SHADOW WAR WITH IRAN Iran sees the continued U.S. military presence in the region as both a threat to its interests and a convenient target.   As Tehran seeks to bolster its deterrence, it may prefer to strike at small numbers of American forces in conflict zones rather than the large U.S. bases in the Gulf. U.S. and Israeli officials blamed Iran for launching a drone attack on the al-Tanf American base in Syria in October, possibly as retaliation for Israeli airstrikes in Syria. The U.S. presence in Iraq has also dwindled to just several thousand troops, which remain exposed to attacks by Iran-backed militias.  The hostility between the United States and Iran is now so deeply rooted within both countries\u2019 establishments\u2014particularly as  hard-liners  have consolidated control in Tehran\u2014that attempts to reset the relationship are unlikely in the coming years. The Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal and adopt a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy designed to isolate Iran diplomatically and economically made Iran more belligerent, not less. Following the United States\u2019 assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020, the two countries engaged in direct military conflict for the first time since the 1980s. Even if American policymakers manage to avoid a full-scale war with Iran and contain its  nuclear ambitions , they will still likely find themselves in a low-grade conflict for regional influence with Tehran.  Though Iran initially maintained its compliance with the nuclear accord following the American withdrawal, it has significantly expanded its program over the last year. It has increased its enrichment of uranium well beyond the constraints of the agreement, moving it closer to weapons-grade levels. Research and development of advanced centrifuges is progressing. Iran\u2019s breakout time, or the time needed to produce enough enriched material to build a nuclear weapon, has shortened to months as opposed to a year under the constraints of the nuclear agreement. Nuclear inspectors are no longer gaining the access required by the agreement. All of these steps have introduced another source of tension in Iran\u2019s relationships with the United States and the international community. It is also no longer clear whether the Iranians are as eager to revive the deal as they once were. Iranian officials were in no hurry to return to talks in Vienna to restore the deal after the election of Ebrahim Raisi as president in June 2021. They have finally agreed to return to negotiations in late November 2021, but it is not clear that the Biden administration will have the political bandwidth to deliver on the sanctions relief necessary to restore the agreement or that Iran will agree to the required nuclear rollbacks. And it is nearly certain that  Israel , toward which the Biden administration has been solicitous, will not support concessions to Iran.  The United States' problem in the Middle East may be not that it is leaving but that it is staying in all the wrong ways. U.S. officials are already in discussions with Israeli counterparts about a \u201cPlan B\u201d should the talks fail. This strategy would include more economic pressure and possibly military options. It is unclear how such \u201cback to the future\u201d policies will bring about a new nuclear deal, particularly without the type of international support that was possible before the 2015 agreement. It is difficult to imagine China signing on to renewed economic pressure against Iran, in light of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington. Indeed, China recently expressed more sympathetic positions on Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment rights following the United States\u2019 and United Kingdom\u2019s decision to sell nuclear submarines to Australia, which Beijing considers a proliferation risk. What may be more likely in the event of a failure to revive the nuclear accord is a repeat of Iran\u2019s response to the Trump administration\u2019s maximum pressure policies: an acceleration of military strikes across the region, including on U.S. forces.  If the deal collapses, it will be even harder for the United States to reduce its presence in the Middle East and shift its focus elsewhere. The Israelis certainly would not put Iran on the back burner, nearly guaranteeing continued escalation. Jerusalem\u2019s \u201cshadow war\u201d with Iran has already expanded considerably: It has moved beyond the Syrian theater, where Israel regularly strikes Iran-aligned targets, to an active maritime confrontation. It has also continued its assassination campaign targeting Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientists and its direct attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure, including an explosion at Iran\u2019s Natanz nuclear facility in April 2021 just as diplomacy in Vienna began. Cyberwarfare between Israel and Iran has even extended to civilian targets.  Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has so far avoided a public spat with Washington over the Iran file. But although his style may differ from the confrontational approach of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his policies do not appear markedly different. Bennett has maintained Israel\u2019s covert military campaign against Iran\u2019s nuclear program and spoken of a \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d strategy toward Tehran. Other Israeli leaders have made public statements reasserting Israel\u2019s right to defend itself against Iran, which is widely understood as Israel preserving its military options. Israel is not a treaty ally of the United States, but the American political commitment to Israel\u2019s security is so deep that it would be difficult for Washington to stay on the sidelines in the event of a full-blown Iranian-Israeli conflict.  The I sraeli-Palestinian conflict  also continues to simmer, even if the Palestinian issue is a lower priority for the region and for Washington. Policymakers may prefer improving the economic conditions of Palestinians over pressing the Israelis on core issues such as settlement expansion. The outbreak of violence in the Gaza Strip in May demonstrated that the United States can work behind the scenes to contain the conflict, but it can\u2019t ignore it. Normalization between Israel and Arab states is a welcome regional development, but it can\u2019t replace a settlement of the parties actually at war.  BECOMING PART OF THE SOLUTION With all these demands, the United States is not going to abandon the Middle East. In fact, it may be facing a different problem\u2014not that it is leaving but that it is staying in all the wrong ways.  The Biden administration appears to be doubling down on military commitments to reassure its partners, who remain skeptical about the trajectory of its foreign policy. The arms sales to  Saudi Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates are proof that Washington still prioritizes its military partnerships in the region. But these efforts, particularly when not balanced with engagement on human security and governance challenges, can fuel regional conflicts and repression. (The United States currently invests as much annually in military assistance to Egypt as it does in economic development assistance for the entire region.) This is a recipe for perpetual crisis, which will force the United States to take costly steps to contain new forms of extremism and violence. A better way forward would be to use the opportunity of regional rebalancing to dial down military commitments and increase economic and development assistance. The United States needs to refocus its attention and resources on the challenges affecting the day-to-day lives of people. Building resilience to climate change in a region already struggling with poor infrastructure and expanding opportunities for youth are the types of issues that should top the agenda when U.S. officials visit the Middle East. American support in these areas should build on work that is already underway but is insufficiently resourced and showcased.  In this moment of strategic flux, the United States has an opportunity to do things differently\u2014to develop and implement a strategy for development and equity. Instead of outsize military investments, it could invest in solutions to the socioeconomic and governance challenges preventing a better life for the region\u2019s citizens. The United States, along with its wealthy allies, could help partners that want to transform the region from a set of problems to a set of possibilities. Either way, the United States and the Middle East are not going to part ways\u2014but Washington should seize the chance to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.

Our answer is yes and no. Yes if we mean a protracted international rivalry, for cold wars in this sense are as old as history itself. Some became hot, some didn\u2019t: no law guarantees either outcome. No if we mean  the  Cold War, which we capitalize because it originated and popularized the term. That struggle took place at a particular time (from 1945\u201347 to 1989\u201391), among particular adversaries (the United States, the Soviet Union, and their respective allies), and over particular issues (post\u2013World War II power balances, ideological clashes, arms races). None of those issues looms as large now, and where parallels do exist\u2014growing bipolarity, intensifying polemics, sharpening distinctions between autocracies and democracies\u2014the context is quite different. It\u2019s no longer debatable that the United States and China, tacit allies during the last half of the last Cold War, are entering their own new cold war: Chinese President  Xi Jinping  has declared it, and a rare bipartisan consensus in the United States has accepted the challenge. What, then, might previous contests\u2014the one and only Cold War and the many earlier cold wars\u2014suggest about this one? The future is, of course, less knowable than the past, but it\u2019s not in all respects unknowable. Time will continue to pass, the law of gravity will still apply, and none of us will outlive our physiological term limits. Are similarly reliable knowns shaping the emerging cold war? If so, what unknowns lurk within them? Thucydides had such predictabilities and surprises in mind when he cautioned, 24 centuries ago, that the future would resemble the past but not in all respects reflect it\u2014even as he also argued that the greatest single war of his time revealed timeless truths about all wars to come. Our purpose here, then, is to show how the greatest unfought war of our time\u2014the Soviet-American Cold War\u2014as well as other prior struggles, might expand experience and enhance resilience in a Sino-American rivalry whose future, hot or cold, remains unclear. That history provides a framework within which to survive uncertainty, and possibly even thrive within it, whatever the rest of the twenty-first century throws our way. Our first known is geography, which continental drift will in time alter, but not in our time. China will remain chiefly a land power, beset by an ancient dilemma. If, in search of strategic depth, it tries to expand its perimeters, it is likely to overstretch its capabilities and provoke resistance from anxious neighbors. If, to regain solvency, it contracts its perimeters, it risks inviting in enemies. Even behind great walls, uneasy lie the heads of those whose boundaries remain unfixed. The United States, in contrast, benefits from boundaries that geography has determined. That\u2019s why the United Kingdom, after 1815, chose not to contest its offspring\u2019s primacy in North America: sustaining armies across 3,000 miles of ocean would have been too costly even for the world\u2019s greatest naval power. Geography gave the Americans hybrid hegemony: control of a continent and unimpeded access to two vast oceans, which they quickly connected with a transcontinental railroad. That allowed them to develop the military-industrial means with which to rescue Europeans in World War I,  World War II , and the Cold War from the attempted continental consolidations they confronted. Why, though, from so safe a perch, did the Americans undertake such daunting commitments? Perhaps they looked in the mirror and feared what they saw: their own example of a country dominating a continent and its oceanic approaches. The trigger warning was Russia\u2019s completion of its trans-Siberian railroad in 1904, a slapdash project soon overtaken by war and revolution\u2014but not before eliciting the British geopolitician Halford Mackinder\u2019s portentous warning that \u201cheartland\u201d control of Eurasian \u201crimlands\u201d could empower new and globally ambitious forms of hybrid hegemony. President Woodrow Wilson had that prospect in mind when he declared war on imperial Germany in 1917, and President Franklin Roosevelt took the argument one step further in 1940\u201341, insisting\u2014correctly, historians have now confirmed\u2014that Adolf Hitler\u2019s ultimate target was the United States itself. So when the American diplomat George Kennan, in 1947, called for \u201ccontaining\u201d an emboldened World War II ally, the Soviet Union, he had long legacies on which to draw. Xi\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) evokes similar concerns. The \u201cbelt\u201d is to be a network of rail and road corridors across Eurasia. The \u201croad\u201d will be sea routes in the Indo-Pacific and, if global warming permits, also in the Arctic, sustained by bases and ports in states made friendly by the BRI's \u201cbenefits.\u201d Nothing Germans or Russians ever attempted combined such ambition with such specificity: China seeks hybrid hegemony on an unprecedented scale. Which brings us to our first unknown: What might that imply for Eurasia and the world beyond? There\u2019s a remarkable record, over the past three centuries, of offshore balancers thwarting aspirants to onshore domination: first Great Britain against France in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, then an Anglo-American coalition against Germany twice during the first half of the twentieth century, followed by a U.S.-led coalition against the Soviet Union in the second half. It\u2019s too easy to claim that maritime states project power without generating resistance, for if that were the case, colonialism would still thrive. But the relationship between geography and governance is clear enough to be our second known. Continents\u2014North America excepted\u2014tend to nurture authoritarians: where geography fails to fix boundaries, harsh hands claim the right and duty to do so, whether as protection from external dangers or to preserve internal order. Liberty, in these situations, is decreed from the top down, not evolved from the bottom up. But that holds such regimes responsible for what happens. They can\u2019t, as democracies regularly do, spread the blame. Autocracies that fall short\u2014such as the Soviet Union\u2014risk hollowing themselves out from within. China\u2019s post\u2013Cold War leaders, having compulsively studied the Soviet example, sought to avoid repeating it by transforming Marxism into consumer capitalism without at the same time allowing democracy. They thereby flipped what they saw as Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s greatest error: permitting democracy without ensuring prosperity. This latest \u201crectification of names\u201d\u2014the ancient Chinese procedure of conforming names to shifting realities\u2014seemed until recently to have succeeded. The Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping\u2019s post-Mao pro-market reforms solidified support for the regime and made China a model for much of the rest of the world. Xi, on taking power, was widely expected to continue along that path. But he hasn\u2019t. Instead, Xi is cutting off access to the outside world, defying international legal norms, and encouraging \u201cWolf Warrior\u201d diplomacy, none of which seems calculated to win or retain allies. At home, he is enforcing orthodoxy, whitewashing history, and oppressing minorities in ways defunct Russian and Chinese emperors might have applauded. Most significant, he has sought to secure these reversals by abolishing his own term limits. Hence our second unknown: Why is Xi undoing the reforms, while abandoning the diplomatic subtlety, that allowed China\u2019s rise in the first place? Perhaps he fears the risks of his own retirement, even though these mount with each rival he imprisons or purges. Perhaps he has realized that innovation requires but may also inspire spontaneity within his country. Perhaps he worries that increasingly hostile international rivals won\u2019t allow him unlimited time to achieve his aims. Perhaps he sees the prevailing concept of world order itself as at odds with a mandate from Heaven, Marx, or Mao. Or it could be that Xi envisions a world order with authoritarianism at its core and with China at its center. Technology, he may expect, will make human consciousness as transparent as satellites made the earth\u2019s surface during the Cold War. China, he may assume, will never alienate its foreign friends. Expectations within China, he may suppose, will never find reasons not to rise. And Xi, as he ages, will gain in the wisdom, energy, and attentiveness to detail that only he, as supreme leader, can trust himself to provide. But if Xi really believes all of this, then he\u2019s already losing sight of the gaps between promises and performance that have long been Catch-22s for authoritarian regimes. For if, like Gorbachev\u2019s predecessors did, you ignore such fissures, they\u2019ll only worsen. But if, like Gorbachev himself, you acknowledge them, you\u2019ll undermine the claim to infallibility on which legitimacy in an autocracy must rest. That is why graceful exits by authoritarians have been so rare. Democracy in America has its own gaps between promises and performance, so much so that it seems at times to suffer from Brezhnev-like paralysis. The United States differs from China, though, in that distrust of authority is constitutionally mandated. The separation of powers secures a center of gravity to which the nation can return after whatever bursts of activity crises may have demanded. The result is what evolutionary biologists call \u201cpunctuated equilibrium\u201d: a resilience rooted in rapid recovery from unforeseen circumstances. China has it the other way around. Respect for authority permeates its culture, but stability is punctuated by protracted upheavals when authority fails. Recovery, in the absence of gravity, can require decades. Autocracies often win sprints, but smart investors put their marathon money on democracies. Our third known, then, is sharply different roots of resilience. The pattern emerges clearly from the two costliest civil wars of the nineteenth century. The Taiping Rebellion of 1850\u201364 took some 20 million Chinese lives, about five percent of the population. The American Civil War of 1861\u201365 killed 750,000 combatants, 2.5 percent of a much less crowded country. And yet by the testimony of its current leaders, China after the Taiping Rebellion underwent decades of turmoil from which it emerged only with Mao\u2019s proclamation of the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. The United States, by that same account, recovered quickly enough to join the European predators victimizing China at the end of the nineteenth century and has continued doing so ever since. Leave aside issues of accuracy in this view of history. Our point is that Xi\u2019s growing reliance on this narrative and the  nationalism  it stokes implies an inflammability in Chinese culture that is currently useful to the regime\u2014but that might not be easily extinguished. Hence our third unknown: Can Xi turn internal outrage on and off, as Mao did repeatedly during his years in power? Or is Xi locking himself into the same dependence on external hostility without which Joseph Stalin, as Kennan put it in 1946, did not know how to rule? Because nothing could reassure such a regime, Kennan insisted, only cumulative frustrations would convince Stalin or, more likely, his successors that it was in their best interests to alter their system\u2019s worst aspects. That strategy depended, however, on neither side setting deadlines: Kennan carefully pointed out that it would never have worked with Hitler, who had a fixed timetable, dictated by his own mortality, for achieving his aims. Mao, craftily, gave his regime 100 years to recover Taiwan. Xi has ruled out passing that problem from generation to generation, although he has not yet set a date for resolving it. Nonetheless, his increasingly aggressive rhetoric adds to the risk that the Taiwan issue could cause a Sino-American cold war to become hot, for the United States has deliberately left its own Taiwan policy unclear. All of which eerily evokes how Europe went to war in 1914: an ambiguity of great-power commitments combined with the absence of an escalation off switch. Except that we have, in the Cold War, an intervening known to draw on: how that conflict transformed itself into a \u201clong peace.\u201d The first half of the twentieth century offered no support for the idea that great-power rivalries could be resolved peacefully. \u201cA future war with Soviet Russia,\u201d the American diplomat Joseph Grew predicted in 1945, \u201cis as certain as anything in the world can be certain.\u201d What allowed the Cold War superpowers to escape that prospect, and how relevant are those circumstances today? One answer is that history itself during those years became prophecy. Given what most leaders had experienced in a second world war, few anywhere were eager to risk a third. It helped also that those in Washington and Moscow, if for different reasons, saw time as an ally: the Americans because the strategy of containment relied on time to thwart Soviet ambitions, Stalin because he expected time to produce fratricidal capitalist wars that would ensure proletarian revolutionary triumphs. Once Stalin\u2019s successors realized the extent of his miscalculations, it was too late to reverse their effects. The Soviet Union spent the rest of the Cold War failing to catch up. But what if determinations to avoid the next war fade with the memories of the last one? That\u2019s how some historians have explained World War I: a century had passed without a European great war. Does it matter that three-quarters of a century now separate American and Chinese leaders from the great wars of their predecessors? Americans have had some combat experience in the \u201climited\u201d and \u201clow-intensity\u201d conflicts in which they have been involved\u2014with decidedly mixed results\u2014but the Chinese, except for their brief invasion of Vietnam in 1979, haven\u2019t fought any significant wars for more than half a century. That may be why Xi, with his \u201cheads bashed bloody\u201d rhetoric, seems to celebrate bellicosity: he may not know what its costs can be. Taiwanese military exercises near Pingtung, Taiwan, April 2010   Nicky Loh / Reuters   A second way in which historians have explained the \u201clong peace\u201d is that nuclear weapons suppressed optimism about how wars might end. There\u2019s no way to know for sure what deterrence in the Cold War deterred: that\u2019s a history that didn\u2019t happen. But this in itself suggests a balanced lack of resolve, for whatever Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and U.S. President John F. Kennedy may have said publicly, neither wanted to die for Berlin. Instead, they accepted a walled city inside a partitioned country in the middle of a divided continent. No grand design could have produced such an oddity, and yet it held up until the Cold War evolved its own peaceful, if equally unexpected, end. None of this could have happened without nuclear capabilities, for only they could put lives on the line simultaneously in Washington and Moscow. So what about Washington and Beijing? Even with recent enhancements, the Chinese deploy less than ten percent of the number of nuclear weapons the United States and Russia retain, and that number is only 15 percent of what the two superpowers had at the height of the Cold War. Does this matter? We doubt it, given what Khrushchev achieved in 1962: despite a nine-to-one disadvantage in nuclear weapons, he deterred the post\u2013Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba that Kennedy had been planning. The United States has lived ever since with its own adjacent anomaly: a communist island in the middle of its self-proclaimed Caribbean sea of influence. It\u2019s even less plausible today that the United States would use nuclear weapons to defend Taiwan, for that island is more important to Beijing than Cuba or Berlin ever was to Moscow. Yet that implausibility could lead Xi to believe that he can invade Taiwan without risking a U.S. nuclear response. China\u2019s growing cyber- and antisatellite capabilities may also encourage him, for they bring back possibilities of surprise attacks that the Cold War\u2019s reconnaissance revolution seemed, for decades, to have diminished. But then what? What would Xi do with Taiwan if he captured it? The island is not Hong Kong, an easily controlled city. Nor is it Crimea, with a largely acquiescent population. Nor are other big islands in the region\u2014Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand\u2014teetering dominoes. Nor would the United States, with its unmatched power-projection capabilities, be likely to \u201csit idly by,\u201d as the Chinese might put it: \u201cambiguity\u201d means keeping options open, not ruling out any response at all. One such response might be to exploit the overstretch that comes from China\u2019s forcefully expanding its perimeters, the self-created problem that once plagued Moscow. Suppressing the \u201cPrague Spring\u201d was simple enough for the Soviet Union in 1968, until military morale plummeted when the Czechs made it clear to their occupiers that they didn\u2019t feel \u201cliberated.\u201d The Brezhnev Doctrine\u2014the commitment to act similarly wherever else \u201csocialism\u201d might be at risk\u2014alarmed more than it reassured the leaders of other such states, notably Mao, who secretly began planning his 1971 \u201copening\u201d to Washington. By the time the Soviet Union invoked the doctrine again, in Afghanistan in 1979, it had few allies left anywhere and none on whose reliability it could count. Xi\u2019s threats to Taiwan could have a similar effect in states surrounding China, which may in turn look for their own \u201copenings\u201d to Washington. Extravagant Chinese claims in the South China Sea have already increased anxieties in that region: witness Australia\u2019s unexpected alignment with the Americans and the British on nuclear submarines, as well as India\u2019s expanded cooperation with Indo-Pacific allies. Central Asians may not indefinitely ignore repressions of Tibetans and Uyghurs. Debt traps, environmental degradation, and onerous repayment terms are souring recipients on the BRI\u2019s benefits. And Russia, the original source of early-twentieth-century concerns about the \u201cheartland,\u201d could now find itself surrounded by Chinese \u201crimlands\u201d in Asia, eastern and southeastern Europe, and even the Arctic. All of which raises the possibility that American unipolarity may end not with a precarious Sino-American bipolarity but with a multipolarity that restrains Beijing by making assertiveness self-defeating. Metternich and Bismarck would have approved. So would a crafty American Cold Warrior who, following their example, hoped to deploy a similar strategy. \u201cI think it will be a safer world and a better world,\u201d President Richard Nixon told  Time  magazine in 1972, \u201cif we have a strong, healthy United States, Europe, Soviet Union, China, Japan, each balancing the other.\u201d Our final known is the inescapability of surprises. International systems are anarchic, theorists tell us, in that no component within them is fully in control. Strategy may reduce uncertainty but will never eliminate it: humans are fallible, and artificial intelligences will surely be also. There are, though, patterns of competition across time and space. It may be possible to derive from these\u2014especially from the Soviet-American Cold War\u2014categories of surprises likely to occur in the Sino-American cold war. Existential surprises are shifts in the arenas within which  great powers  compete, for which neither is responsible but that endanger them both. U.S. President Ronald Reagan had this in mind when he surprised Gorbachev at their first meeting, in 1985, with the claim that a Martian invasion would force the United States and the Soviet Union to settle their differences overnight: Weren\u2019t nuclear weapons at least as dangerous? Martians haven\u2019t yet arrived, but we do face two new existential threats: the accelerating rate of climate change and the almost overnight outbreak, in 2020, of a global pandemic. Neither is unprecedented. Climates have always fluctuated, which is why it used to be possible to walk from Siberia to Alaska. Thucydides described the plague that struck Athens in 430 BC. What is new is the extent to which globalization has accelerated these phenomena, raising the question of whether geopolitical rivals can collaboratively address the deep histories that are increasingly altering their own. The Soviet-American Cold War showed that cooperation to avoid catastrophe need not be explicit: no treaty specified that nuclear weapons, after 1945, would not again be used in war. Instead, existential dangers produced tacit cooperation where negotiated formalities almost surely would have failed. Climate change may present similar opportunities in the Sino-American cold war, even if COVID-19 has so far spurred only Chinese abrasiveness. The point should be to keep landing sites for Martian equivalents open\u2014not to welcome existential problems but to explore whether collaborative outcomes can result from them. Intentional surprises originate in efforts by single competitors to startle, confuse, or dismay their adversaries. Surprise attacks, as on Pearl Harbor, fit this category, and intelligence failures can never be ruled out. The Cold War\u2019s greatest surprises, however, arose from reversals of polarity, of which Mao was a master. When he leaned east, in 1949\u201350, he blindsided the Truman administration and opened the way for the Korean War and a communist offensive in Asia. When he leaned west, in 1970\u201371, he made the United States an ally while rendering the Soviet Union vulnerable on two fronts, a disadvantage from which it never recovered. That\u2019s why an American \u201copening\u201d to Moscow might someday turn it against Beijing. The original Sino-Soviet split took two decades to develop, with the Eisenhower administration seeking to speed the process by driving Mao into a mutually repulsive relationship with Khrushchev. Xi\u2019s BRI may be accomplishing this on its own with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long complained about U.S. \u201ccontainment\u201d of Russia. Chinese \u201ccontainment,\u201d from the Kremlin\u2019s perspective, may ultimately become the greater danger. A wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Moscow, May 2015   Sputnik Photo Agency / Reuters   One other form of intentional surprise comes from supposed subordinates who turn out not to be. Neither Washington nor Moscow wanted the offshore island crises of 1954\u201355 and 1958: Chiang Kai-shek, in Taipei, and Mao, in Beijing, made them happen. The communist leader Walter Ulbricht\u2019s warnings of an imminent East German collapse forced Khrushchev to provoke the Berlin crises of 1958\u201359 and 1961. Smaller powers pursuing their own agendas derailed Soviet-American d\u00e9tente in the 1970s: Egypt by attacking Israel in 1973; Cuba by intervening in Africa in 1975\u201377; and Hafizullah Amin in Afghanistan, whose reported contacts with U.S. officials triggered a self-defeating Soviet invasion in 1979. None of this, though, was unprecedented: Thucydides showed Corinth and Corcyra doing something similar to the Spartans and the Athenians 24 centuries earlier. The potential for tails wagging dogs in the  Sino-American cold  war is already evident: rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait have resulted as much from changes in Taiwanese politics in recent years as from deliberate decisions in Washington or Beijing. And while China is trying, through the BRI, to create a system that maximizes its power, it may end up building, through its relationships with insecure and unstable regimes, just the sort of inverse dependency that vexed the Cold War superpowers. That can be a formula for volatility: history is full of instances in which local actors embroiled larger powers. Finally, there are systemic surprises. The Cold War ended in a way no one at the time had expected: with the sudden collapse of a superpower and its accompanying ideology. Two visionaries who had foreseen such a possibility, however, were that doctrine\u2019s mid-nineteenth-century founders, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Capitalism, they were sure, would eventually destroy itself by creating too great a gap between the means of production and the benefits it distributed. Kennan, a century later, turned Marx and Engels upside down. The gap between productive means and distributed benefits would instead, he insisted in 1946\u201347, bring about the collapse of communism within the Soviet Union and its post\u2013World War II satellite states. Kennan didn\u2019t welcome what finally happened in 1990\u201391: the implosion of the Soviet Union itself was too great a disruption in the balance of power even for him. But he did understand how stresses within societies can themselves greatly surprise. No one can predict when some new geopolitical earthquake might occur: geological earthquakes are difficult enough to anticipate. Geologists do know, however, where to expect them: that is why California gets earthquake warnings but Connecticut does not. Does the very brittleness of authoritarian regimes\u2014their strange belief in the immortality of top-down command structures\u2014leave them similarly vulnerable? Or does the entrenched recalcitrance of democracies\u2014their resistance to being commanded\u2014pose even greater dangers to them? Only time will tell, probably sooner than we expect. This aggregation of knowns, unknowns, and surprises leaves us with the historical equivalent of a three-body problem: given the coexistence of predictability and its opposite, we\u2019ll know the outcome only when we\u2019ve seen it. Strategy, however, doesn\u2019t have that luxury. Its success requires living with uncertainties, of which the future will not be in short supply. The strategy of containment, although imperfect in its accomplishments and at times tragic in its failures, did successfully manage its own contradictions while buying the time necessary for those within the Soviet system to become obvious, even, in the end, to its own leaders. It did this chiefly by combining simplicity of conception with flexibility in application, for even the clearest of destinations may not always, or even often, reveal the paths by which to reach them. It may be necessary, for example, to cooperate with Stalin to defeat Hitler, or with Tito to resist Stalin, or with Mao to confound Brezhnev: not all evils are equally so at all times. Nor are arms buildups always bad or negotiations always good: Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, and Reagan employed both to begin transformations of the adversaries confronting them. Kennan distrusted such elasticities in the pursuit of containment, but it was precisely this maneuverability that ensured the strategy\u2019s safe arrival at its intended destination. A second way in which containment succeeded was by treating spontaneity as a strength. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was as much a European as an American creation, in striking contrast to its Moscow-dominated rival, the Warsaw Pact. Nor, outside of Europe, did the United States insist on ideological uniformity among its friends. The objective instead was to make diversity a weapon against a rival bent on suppressing it: to use the resistance to uniformity embedded within distinctive histories, cultures, and faiths as a barrier against the homogenizing ambitions of would-be hegemons. A third asset, although it didn\u2019t always seem so at the time, was the American election cycle. Quadrennial stress tests for containment unnerved its architects, upset sympathetic pundits, and alarmed overseas allies, but they were at least safeguards against ossification. No long-term strategy can succeed if it allows aspirations to outrun its capabilities or capabilities to corrupt its aspirations. How, though, do strategists develop the self-awareness\u2014and the self-confidence\u2014to acknowledge that their strategies are not working? Elections are, for sure, blunt instruments. They are better, though, than having no means of reconsideration apart from the demise of aged autocrats, the timing of whose departure from this world is not given to their followers to know. There are thus, in the United States, no exclusively foreign affairs. Because Americans proclaim their ideals so explicitly, they illustrate departures from them all the more vividly. Domestic failures such as economic inequality, racial segregation, sexual discrimination, environmental degradation, and top-level extraconstitutional excesses all go on display for the world to see. As Kennan pointed out in the most quoted article ever published  in these pages , \u201cExhibitions of indecision, disunity and internal disintegration within this country\u201d can \u201chave an exhilarating effect\u201d on external enemies. To defend its external interests, then, \u201cthe United States need only measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation.\u201d Easily said, not easily done, and therein lies the ultimate test for the United States in its contest with China: the patient management of internal threats to our democracy, as well as tolerance of the moral and geopolitical contradictions through which global diversity can most feasibly be defended. The study of history is the best compass we have in navigating this future\u2014even if it turns out to be not what we\u2019d expected and not in most respects what we\u2019ve experienced before.

Yes if we mean a protracted international rivalry, for cold wars in this sense are as old as history itself. Some became hot, some didn\u2019t: no law guarantees either outcome. No if we mean @@ Cold War, which we capitalize because it originated and popularized the term. That struggle took place at a particular time (from 1945\u201347 to 1989\u201391), among particular adversaries (the United States, the Soviet Union, and their respective allies), and over particular issues (post\u2013World War II power balances, ideological clashes, arms races). None of those issues looms as large now, and where parallels do exist\u2014growing bipolarity, intensifying polemics, sharpening distinctions between autocracies and democracies\u2014the context is quite different.@@It\u2019s no longer debatable that the United States and China, tacit allies during the last half of the last Cold War, are entering their own new cold war: Chinese President @@ has declared it, and a rare bipartisan consensus in the United States has accepted the challenge. What, then, might previous contests\u2014the one and only Cold War and the many earlier cold wars\u2014suggest about this one?@@The future is, of course, less knowable than the past, but it\u2019s not in all respects unknowable. Time will continue to pass, the law of gravity will still apply, and none of us will outlive our physiological term limits. Are similarly reliable knowns shaping the emerging cold war? If so, what unknowns lurk within them? Thucydides had such predictabilities and surprises in mind when he cautioned, 24 centuries ago, that the future would resemble the past but not in all respects reflect it\u2014even as he also argued that the greatest single war of his time revealed timeless truths about all wars to come.@@Our purpose here, then, is to show how the greatest unfought war of our time\u2014the Soviet-American Cold War\u2014as well as other prior struggles, might expand experience and enhance resilience in a Sino-American rivalry whose future, hot or cold, remains unclear. That history provides a framework within which to survive uncertainty, and possibly even thrive within it, whatever the rest of the twenty-first century throws our way.@@Our first known is geography, which continental drift will in time alter, but not in our time. China will remain chiefly a land power, beset by an ancient dilemma. If, in search of strategic depth, it tries to expand its perimeters, it is likely to overstretch its capabilities and provoke resistance from anxious neighbors. If, to regain solvency, it contracts its perimeters, it risks inviting in enemies. Even behind great walls, uneasy lie the heads of those whose boundaries remain unfixed.@@The United States, in contrast, benefits from boundaries that geography has determined. That\u2019s why the United Kingdom, after 1815, chose not to contest its offspring\u2019s primacy in North America: sustaining armies across 3,000 miles of ocean would have been too costly even for the world\u2019s greatest naval power. Geography gave the Americans hybrid hegemony: control of a continent and unimpeded access to two vast oceans, which they quickly connected with a transcontinental railroad. That allowed them to develop the military-industrial means with which to rescue Europeans in World War I, @@, and the Cold War from the attempted continental consolidations they confronted.@@Why, though, from so safe a perch, did the Americans undertake such daunting commitments? Perhaps they looked in the mirror and feared what they saw: their own example of a country dominating a continent and its oceanic approaches. The trigger warning was Russia\u2019s completion of its trans-Siberian railroad in 1904, a slapdash project soon overtaken by war and revolution\u2014but not before eliciting the British geopolitician Halford Mackinder\u2019s portentous warning that \u201cheartland\u201d control of Eurasian \u201crimlands\u201d could empower new and globally ambitious forms of hybrid hegemony. President Woodrow Wilson had that prospect in mind when he declared war on imperial Germany in 1917, and President Franklin Roosevelt took the argument one step further in 1940\u201341, insisting\u2014correctly, historians have now confirmed\u2014that Adolf Hitler\u2019s ultimate target was the United States itself. So when the American diplomat George Kennan, in 1947, called for \u201ccontaining\u201d an emboldened World War II ally, the Soviet Union, he had long legacies on which to draw.@@Xi\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) evokes similar concerns. The \u201cbelt\u201d is to be a network of rail and road corridors across Eurasia. The \u201croad\u201d will be sea routes in the Indo-Pacific and, if global warming permits, also in the Arctic, sustained by bases and ports in states made friendly by the BRI's \u201cbenefits.\u201d Nothing Germans or Russians ever attempted combined such ambition with such specificity: China seeks hybrid hegemony on an unprecedented scale. Which brings us to our first unknown: What might that imply for Eurasia and the world beyond?@@There\u2019s a remarkable record, over the past three centuries, of offshore balancers thwarting aspirants to onshore domination: first Great Britain against France in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, then an Anglo-American coalition against Germany twice during the first half of the twentieth century, followed by a U.S.-led coalition against the Soviet Union in the second half. It\u2019s too easy to claim that maritime states project power without generating resistance, for if that were the case, colonialism would still thrive. But the relationship between geography and governance is clear enough to be our second known.@@Continents\u2014North America excepted\u2014tend to nurture authoritarians: where geography fails to fix boundaries, harsh hands claim the right and duty to do so, whether as protection from external dangers or to preserve internal order. Liberty, in these situations, is decreed from the top down, not evolved from the bottom up. But that holds such regimes responsible for what happens. They can\u2019t, as democracies regularly do, spread the blame. Autocracies that fall short\u2014such as the Soviet Union\u2014risk hollowing themselves out from within.@@China\u2019s post\u2013Cold War leaders, having compulsively studied the Soviet example, sought to avoid repeating it by transforming Marxism into consumer capitalism without at the same time allowing democracy. They thereby flipped what they saw as Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s greatest error: permitting democracy without ensuring prosperity. This latest \u201crectification of names\u201d\u2014the ancient Chinese procedure of conforming names to shifting realities\u2014seemed until recently to have succeeded. The Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping\u2019s post-Mao pro-market reforms solidified support for the regime and made China a model for much of the rest of the world. Xi, on taking power, was widely expected to continue along that path.@@But he hasn\u2019t. Instead, Xi is cutting off access to the outside world, defying international legal norms, and encouraging \u201cWolf Warrior\u201d diplomacy, none of which seems calculated to win or retain allies. At home, he is enforcing orthodoxy, whitewashing history, and oppressing minorities in ways defunct Russian and Chinese emperors might have applauded. Most significant, he has sought to secure these reversals by abolishing his own term limits.@@Hence our second unknown: Why is Xi undoing the reforms, while abandoning the diplomatic subtlety, that allowed China\u2019s rise in the first place? Perhaps he fears the risks of his own retirement, even though these mount with each rival he imprisons or purges. Perhaps he has realized that innovation requires but may also inspire spontaneity within his country. Perhaps he worries that increasingly hostile international rivals won\u2019t allow him unlimited time to achieve his aims. Perhaps he sees the prevailing concept of world order itself as at odds with a mandate from Heaven, Marx, or Mao.@@Or it could be that Xi envisions a world order with authoritarianism at its core and with China at its center. Technology, he may expect, will make human consciousness as transparent as satellites made the earth\u2019s surface during the Cold War. China, he may assume, will never alienate its foreign friends. Expectations within China, he may suppose, will never find reasons not to rise. And Xi, as he ages, will gain in the wisdom, energy, and attentiveness to detail that only he, as supreme leader, can trust himself to provide.@@But if Xi really believes all of this, then he\u2019s already losing sight of the gaps between promises and performance that have long been Catch-22s for authoritarian regimes. For if, like Gorbachev\u2019s predecessors did, you ignore such fissures, they\u2019ll only worsen. But if, like Gorbachev himself, you acknowledge them, you\u2019ll undermine the claim to infallibility on which legitimacy in an autocracy must rest. That is why graceful exits by authoritarians have been so rare.@@Democracy in America has its own gaps between promises and performance, so much so that it seems at times to suffer from Brezhnev-like paralysis. The United States differs from China, though, in that distrust of authority is constitutionally mandated. The separation of powers secures a center of gravity to which the nation can return after whatever bursts of activity crises may have demanded. The result is what evolutionary biologists call \u201cpunctuated equilibrium\u201d: a resilience rooted in rapid recovery from unforeseen circumstances. China has it the other way around. Respect for authority permeates its culture, but stability is punctuated by protracted upheavals when authority fails. Recovery, in the absence of gravity, can require decades. Autocracies often win sprints, but smart investors put their marathon money on democracies. Our third known, then, is sharply different roots of resilience.@@The pattern emerges clearly from the two costliest civil wars of the nineteenth century. The Taiping Rebellion of 1850\u201364 took some 20 million Chinese lives, about five percent of the population. The American Civil War of 1861\u201365 killed 750,000 combatants, 2.5 percent of a much less crowded country. And yet by the testimony of its current leaders, China after the Taiping Rebellion underwent decades of turmoil from which it emerged only with Mao\u2019s proclamation of the People\u2019s Republic in 1949. The United States, by that same account, recovered quickly enough to join the European predators victimizing China at the end of the nineteenth century and has continued doing so ever since. Leave aside issues of accuracy in this view of history. Our point is that Xi\u2019s growing reliance on this narrative and the @@ it stokes implies an inflammability in Chinese culture that is currently useful to the regime\u2014but that might not be easily extinguished.@@Hence our third unknown: Can Xi turn internal outrage on and off, as Mao did repeatedly during his years in power? Or is Xi locking himself into the same dependence on external hostility without which Joseph Stalin, as Kennan put it in 1946, did not know how to rule? Because nothing could reassure such a regime, Kennan insisted, only cumulative frustrations would convince Stalin or, more likely, his successors that it was in their best interests to alter their system\u2019s worst aspects. That strategy depended, however, on neither side setting deadlines: Kennan carefully pointed out that it would never have worked with Hitler, who had a fixed timetable, dictated by his own mortality, for achieving his aims.@@Mao, craftily, gave his regime 100 years to recover Taiwan. Xi has ruled out passing that problem from generation to generation, although he has not yet set a date for resolving it. Nonetheless, his increasingly aggressive rhetoric adds to the risk that the Taiwan issue could cause a Sino-American cold war to become hot, for the United States has deliberately left its own Taiwan policy unclear. All of which eerily evokes how Europe went to war in 1914: an ambiguity of great-power commitments combined with the absence of an escalation off switch.@@Except that we have, in the Cold War, an intervening known to draw on: how that conflict transformed itself into a \u201clong peace.\u201d The first half of the twentieth century offered no support for the idea that great-power rivalries could be resolved peacefully. \u201cA future war with Soviet Russia,\u201d the American diplomat Joseph Grew predicted in 1945, \u201cis as certain as anything in the world can be certain.\u201d What allowed the Cold War superpowers to escape that prospect, and how relevant are those circumstances today?@@One answer is that history itself during those years became prophecy. Given what most leaders had experienced in a second world war, few anywhere were eager to risk a third. It helped also that those in Washington and Moscow, if for different reasons, saw time as an ally: the Americans because the strategy of containment relied on time to thwart Soviet ambitions, Stalin because he expected time to produce fratricidal capitalist wars that would ensure proletarian revolutionary triumphs. Once Stalin\u2019s successors realized the extent of his miscalculations, it was too late to reverse their effects. The Soviet Union spent the rest of the Cold War failing to catch up.@@But what if determinations to avoid the next war fade with the memories of the last one? That\u2019s how some historians have explained World War I: a century had passed without a European great war. Does it matter that three-quarters of a century now separate American and Chinese leaders from the great wars of their predecessors? Americans have had some combat experience in the \u201climited\u201d and \u201clow-intensity\u201d conflicts in which they have been involved\u2014with decidedly mixed results\u2014but the Chinese, except for their brief invasion of Vietnam in 1979, haven\u2019t fought any significant wars for more than half a century. That may be why Xi, with his \u201cheads bashed bloody\u201d rhetoric, seems to celebrate bellicosity: he may not know what its costs can be.@@A second way in which historians have explained the \u201clong peace\u201d is that nuclear weapons suppressed optimism about how wars might end. There\u2019s no way to know for sure what deterrence in the Cold War deterred: that\u2019s a history that didn\u2019t happen. But this in itself suggests a balanced lack of resolve, for whatever Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and U.S. President John F. Kennedy may have said publicly, neither wanted to die for Berlin. Instead, they accepted a walled city inside a partitioned country in the middle of a divided continent. No grand design could have produced such an oddity, and yet it held up until the Cold War evolved its own peaceful, if equally unexpected, end. None of this could have happened without nuclear capabilities, for only they could put lives on the line simultaneously in Washington and Moscow.@@So what about Washington and Beijing? Even with recent enhancements, the Chinese deploy less than ten percent of the number of nuclear weapons the United States and Russia retain, and that number is only 15 percent of what the two superpowers had at the height of the Cold War. Does this matter? We doubt it, given what Khrushchev achieved in 1962: despite a nine-to-one disadvantage in nuclear weapons, he deterred the post\u2013Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba that Kennedy had been planning. The United States has lived ever since with its own adjacent anomaly: a communist island in the middle of its self-proclaimed Caribbean sea of influence.@@It\u2019s even less plausible today that the United States would use nuclear weapons to defend Taiwan, for that island is more important to Beijing than Cuba or Berlin ever was to Moscow. Yet that implausibility could lead Xi to believe that he can invade Taiwan without risking a U.S. nuclear response. China\u2019s growing cyber- and antisatellite capabilities may also encourage him, for they bring back possibilities of surprise attacks that the Cold War\u2019s reconnaissance revolution seemed, for decades, to have diminished.@@But then what? What would Xi do with Taiwan if he captured it? The island is not Hong Kong, an easily controlled city. Nor is it Crimea, with a largely acquiescent population. Nor are other big islands in the region\u2014Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand\u2014teetering dominoes. Nor would the United States, with its unmatched power-projection capabilities, be likely to \u201csit idly by,\u201d as the Chinese might put it: \u201cambiguity\u201d means keeping options open, not ruling out any response at all.@@One such response might be to exploit the overstretch that comes from China\u2019s forcefully expanding its perimeters, the self-created problem that once plagued Moscow. Suppressing the \u201cPrague Spring\u201d was simple enough for the Soviet Union in 1968, until military morale plummeted when the Czechs made it clear to their occupiers that they didn\u2019t feel \u201cliberated.\u201d The Brezhnev Doctrine\u2014the commitment to act similarly wherever else \u201csocialism\u201d might be at risk\u2014alarmed more than it reassured the leaders of other such states, notably Mao, who secretly began planning his 1971 \u201copening\u201d to Washington. By the time the Soviet Union invoked the doctrine again, in Afghanistan in 1979, it had few allies left anywhere and none on whose reliability it could count.@@Xi\u2019s threats to Taiwan could have a similar effect in states surrounding China, which may in turn look for their own \u201copenings\u201d to Washington. Extravagant Chinese claims in the South China Sea have already increased anxieties in that region: witness Australia\u2019s unexpected alignment with the Americans and the British on nuclear submarines, as well as India\u2019s expanded cooperation with Indo-Pacific allies. Central Asians may not indefinitely ignore repressions of Tibetans and Uyghurs. Debt traps, environmental degradation, and onerous repayment terms are souring recipients on the BRI\u2019s benefits. And Russia, the original source of early-twentieth-century concerns about the \u201cheartland,\u201d could now find itself surrounded by Chinese \u201crimlands\u201d in Asia, eastern and southeastern Europe, and even the Arctic.@@All of which raises the possibility that American unipolarity may end not with a precarious Sino-American bipolarity but with a multipolarity that restrains Beijing by making assertiveness self-defeating. Metternich and Bismarck would have approved. So would a crafty American Cold Warrior who, following their example, hoped to deploy a similar strategy. \u201cI think it will be a safer world and a better world,\u201d President Richard Nixon told @@ magazine in 1972, \u201cif we have a strong, healthy United States, Europe, Soviet Union, China, Japan, each balancing the other.\u201d@@Our final known is the inescapability of surprises. International systems are anarchic, theorists tell us, in that no component within them is fully in control. Strategy may reduce uncertainty but will never eliminate it: humans are fallible, and artificial intelligences will surely be also. There are, though, patterns of competition across time and space. It may be possible to derive from these\u2014especially from the Soviet-American Cold War\u2014categories of surprises likely to occur in the Sino-American cold war.@@Existential surprises are shifts in the arenas within which @@ compete, for which neither is responsible but that endanger them both. U.S. President Ronald Reagan had this in mind when he surprised Gorbachev at their first meeting, in 1985, with the claim that a Martian invasion would force the United States and the Soviet Union to settle their differences overnight: Weren\u2019t nuclear weapons at least as dangerous? Martians haven\u2019t yet arrived, but we do face two new existential threats: the accelerating rate of climate change and the almost overnight outbreak, in 2020, of a global pandemic.@@Neither is unprecedented. Climates have always fluctuated, which is why it used to be possible to walk from Siberia to Alaska. Thucydides described the plague that struck Athens in 430 BC. What is new is the extent to which globalization has accelerated these phenomena, raising the question of whether geopolitical rivals can collaboratively address the deep histories that are increasingly altering their own.@@The Soviet-American Cold War showed that cooperation to avoid catastrophe need not be explicit: no treaty specified that nuclear weapons, after 1945, would not again be used in war. Instead, existential dangers produced tacit cooperation where negotiated formalities almost surely would have failed. Climate change may present similar opportunities in the Sino-American cold war, even if COVID-19 has so far spurred only Chinese abrasiveness. The point should be to keep landing sites for Martian equivalents open\u2014not to welcome existential problems but to explore whether collaborative outcomes can result from them.@@Intentional surprises originate in efforts by single competitors to startle, confuse, or dismay their adversaries. Surprise attacks, as on Pearl Harbor, fit this category, and intelligence failures can never be ruled out. The Cold War\u2019s greatest surprises, however, arose from reversals of polarity, of which Mao was a master. When he leaned east, in 1949\u201350, he blindsided the Truman administration and opened the way for the Korean War and a communist offensive in Asia. When he leaned west, in 1970\u201371, he made the United States an ally while rendering the Soviet Union vulnerable on two fronts, a disadvantage from which it never recovered.@@That\u2019s why an American \u201copening\u201d to Moscow might someday turn it against Beijing. The original Sino-Soviet split took two decades to develop, with the Eisenhower administration seeking to speed the process by driving Mao into a mutually repulsive relationship with Khrushchev. Xi\u2019s BRI may be accomplishing this on its own with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long complained about U.S. \u201ccontainment\u201d of Russia. Chinese \u201ccontainment,\u201d from the Kremlin\u2019s perspective, may ultimately become the greater danger.@@One other form of intentional surprise comes from supposed subordinates who turn out not to be. Neither Washington nor Moscow wanted the offshore island crises of 1954\u201355 and 1958: Chiang Kai-shek, in Taipei, and Mao, in Beijing, made them happen. The communist leader Walter Ulbricht\u2019s warnings of an imminent East German collapse forced Khrushchev to provoke the Berlin crises of 1958\u201359 and 1961. Smaller powers pursuing their own agendas derailed Soviet-American d\u00e9tente in the 1970s: Egypt by attacking Israel in 1973; Cuba by intervening in Africa in 1975\u201377; and Hafizullah Amin in Afghanistan, whose reported contacts with U.S. officials triggered a self-defeating Soviet invasion in 1979. None of this, though, was unprecedented: Thucydides showed Corinth and Corcyra doing something similar to the Spartans and the Athenians 24 centuries earlier.@@The potential for tails wagging dogs in the @@ war is already evident: rising tensions in the Taiwan Strait have resulted as much from changes in Taiwanese politics in recent years as from deliberate decisions in Washington or Beijing. And while China is trying, through the BRI, to create a system that maximizes its power, it may end up building, through its relationships with insecure and unstable regimes, just the sort of inverse dependency that vexed the Cold War superpowers. That can be a formula for volatility: history is full of instances in which local actors embroiled larger powers.@@Finally, there are systemic surprises. The Cold War ended in a way no one at the time had expected: with the sudden collapse of a superpower and its accompanying ideology. Two visionaries who had foreseen such a possibility, however, were that doctrine\u2019s mid-nineteenth-century founders, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. Capitalism, they were sure, would eventually destroy itself by creating too great a gap between the means of production and the benefits it distributed. Kennan, a century later, turned Marx and Engels upside down. The gap between productive means and distributed benefits would instead, he insisted in 1946\u201347, bring about the collapse of communism within the Soviet Union and its post\u2013World War II satellite states. Kennan didn\u2019t welcome what finally happened in 1990\u201391: the implosion of the Soviet Union itself was too great a disruption in the balance of power even for him. But he did understand how stresses within societies can themselves greatly surprise.@@No one can predict when some new geopolitical earthquake might occur: geological earthquakes are difficult enough to anticipate. Geologists do know, however, where to expect them: that is why California gets earthquake warnings but Connecticut does not. Does the very brittleness of authoritarian regimes\u2014their strange belief in the immortality of top-down command structures\u2014leave them similarly vulnerable? Or does the entrenched recalcitrance of democracies\u2014their resistance to being commanded\u2014pose even greater dangers to them? Only time will tell, probably sooner than we expect.@@This aggregation of knowns, unknowns, and surprises leaves us with the historical equivalent of a three-body problem: given the coexistence of predictability and its opposite, we\u2019ll know the outcome only when we\u2019ve seen it. Strategy, however, doesn\u2019t have that luxury. Its success requires living with uncertainties, of which the future will not be in short supply. The strategy of containment, although imperfect in its accomplishments and at times tragic in its failures, did successfully manage its own contradictions while buying the time necessary for those within the Soviet system to become obvious, even, in the end, to its own leaders.@@It did this chiefly by combining simplicity of conception with flexibility in application, for even the clearest of destinations may not always, or even often, reveal the paths by which to reach them. It may be necessary, for example, to cooperate with Stalin to defeat Hitler, or with Tito to resist Stalin, or with Mao to confound Brezhnev: not all evils are equally so at all times. Nor are arms buildups always bad or negotiations always good: Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, and Reagan employed both to begin transformations of the adversaries confronting them. Kennan distrusted such elasticities in the pursuit of containment, but it was precisely this maneuverability that ensured the strategy\u2019s safe arrival at its intended destination.@@A second way in which containment succeeded was by treating spontaneity as a strength. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was as much a European as an American creation, in striking contrast to its Moscow-dominated rival, the Warsaw Pact. Nor, outside of Europe, did the United States insist on ideological uniformity among its friends. The objective instead was to make diversity a weapon against a rival bent on suppressing it: to use the resistance to uniformity embedded within distinctive histories, cultures, and faiths as a barrier against the homogenizing ambitions of would-be hegemons.@@A third asset, although it didn\u2019t always seem so at the time, was the American election cycle. Quadrennial stress tests for containment unnerved its architects, upset sympathetic pundits, and alarmed overseas allies, but they were at least safeguards against ossification. No long-term strategy can succeed if it allows aspirations to outrun its capabilities or capabilities to corrupt its aspirations. How, though, do strategists develop the self-awareness\u2014and the self-confidence\u2014to acknowledge that their strategies are not working? Elections are, for sure, blunt instruments. They are better, though, than having no means of reconsideration apart from the demise of aged autocrats, the timing of whose departure from this world is not given to their followers to know.@@There are thus, in the United States, no exclusively foreign affairs. Because Americans proclaim their ideals so explicitly, they illustrate departures from them all the more vividly. Domestic failures such as economic inequality, racial segregation, sexual discrimination, environmental degradation, and top-level extraconstitutional excesses all go on display for the world to see. As Kennan pointed out in the most quoted article ever published @@, \u201cExhibitions of indecision, disunity and internal disintegration within this country\u201d can \u201chave an exhilarating effect\u201d on external enemies. To defend its external interests, then, \u201cthe United States need only measure up to its own best traditions and prove itself worthy of preservation as a great nation.\u201d@@Easily said, not easily done, and therein lies the ultimate test for the United States in its contest with China: the patient management of internal threats to our democracy, as well as tolerance of the moral and geopolitical contradictions through which global diversity can most feasibly be defended. The study of history is the best compass we have in navigating this future\u2014even if it turns out to be not what we\u2019d expected and not in most respects what we\u2019ve experienced before.",

It has   built hundreds of long-range and precise ballistic missiles, launching them for years at mockups of U.S. ships and bases in Asia. It has constructed the world\u2019s largest navy in terms of the number of ships, vastly exceeding the U.S. Navy\u2019s rate of warship production in recent years. As Beijing has grown stronger, it has also become increasingly belligerent: it bullies neighbors that have had the temerity to use their own natural resources, and its state-controlled media routinely threaten  Taiwan  with invasion. \u00a0 But in \u201c America Is Turning Asia Into a Powder Keg \u201d (October 22), Van Jackson argues that an \u201coverly militarized\u201d U.S. approach is to blame for increasing the risk of war and worsening negative regional trends. Although Jackson concedes that Washington is not \u201cthe cause of these troubling trends,\u201d and \u201cshould not be blamed for the actions of China and North Korea,\u201d his article leaves the opposite impression. Furthermore, he makes his case by presenting facts that are at times misleading, mischaracterized, or inaccurate. He portrays as recklessness what is in fact a rational U.S. and allied response to a dramatic expansion of China\u2019s offensive military capabilities. Jackson starts by blaming Washington for \u201csurging troops and military hardware into the region.\u201d Although there have been a number of initiatives to \u201cpivot to the Pacific\u201d and rebalance the U.S. military toward Asia, the change in American troop presence has not been as dramatic as this rhetoric suggests. According to the Pentagon\u2019s  personnel records , roughly 89,000 U.S. active-duty troops were stationed in the Indo-Pacific theater as of this summer. A decade ago, the number was about 84,000. An increase of 5,000 troops, constituting less than half a percent of the U.S. armed forces\u2019 personnel, does not constitute a \u201csurge\u201d that is aggravating tensions in the region, even if one takes into account the few thousand additional soldiers that are likely present at any time on rotational missions. Jackson also blames the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden for embarking on defense initiatives that he claims escalate an arms race with China. He cites its encouragement of Japan to develop hypersonic weapons (a program that was unveiled in March 2020, ten months before Biden\u2019s inauguration) and extend the range of its antiship missiles (also begun in 2020). He further states that the administration has announced plans for an expanded presence in Guam\u2014reference to the ongoing move of 5,000 U.S. Marines to Guam from Okinawa, Japan (farther away from China), which has been planned since 2006. Finally, he mentions a new base in Papua New Guinea\u2014actually an upgrade of an existing base, which was announced in 2018\u2014and new radars in Palau, which lie more than 1,500 miles from China and whose arrival was first announced in 2017. These policies to counter China\u2019s growing military threat should not be attributed solely to Biden\u2019s team; instead, they represent a cross-administration and bipartisan effort to cope with the clear reality of a rapidly deteriorating military balance. In the realm of nuclear forces, Jackson also mischaracterizes the timeline of events and gets some of the details wrong. He states, for example, that the \u201cthe Trump administration drew up plans for a three-decade nuclear modernization effort that would\u00a0cost between $1.2 and $1.7 trillion\u201d and points to China\u2019s expansion of its nuclear arsenal as one reason for this initiative. In fact, President Donald Trump inherited those plans from his predecessor, Barack Obama. And although China\u2019s activities constitute one factor in Washington\u2019s need to maintain a nuclear deterrent force, far and away the greatest reason for the modernization program is the aging of decades-old U.S. nuclear platforms, which are vital to U.S. national security for a host of reasons, many of which have nothing to do with China.   As Beijing has grown stronger, it has also become increasingly belligerent. Jackson also mischaracterizes U.S. nuclear modernization plans as an \u201cexpansion.\u201d In reality, the plans will reduce the number of nuclear-only strategic launchers\u2014that is, intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles\u2014that Washington maintains. The U.S. Air Force will reuse launch facilities, and the ballistic missile submarine force will drop from 14 to 12 submarines and from 20 to 16 missile tubes on each one. The air force\u2019s planned purchase of B-21 bombers will increase the number of aircraft, but the new bombers are intended for both nuclear and conventional roles. And although Jackson describes the B-21 as replacing the current B-2 bomber force with \u201cmore than six times as many planes,\u201d the B-21s will in fact replace both the B-2 and the larger B-1 fleet\u2014and possibly even the venerable force of 1960s-built B-52s. Finally, Jackson asserts that China\u2019s recent and breathtaking  nuclear expansion  is \u201cclearly a response to the gratuitous, unrestrained nuclear policies of the Trump administration.\u201d This is far from clear, however. Several other factors may account for China\u2019s moves: Beijing may want to be able to overwhelm U.S. missile defenses, may be trying to escape U.S. nuclear coercion, or may be seeking to maintain leverage in the event of a conventional conflict. And China\u2019s leaders stated in 2017\u2014well before the release of the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 Nuclear Posture Review and National Defense Strategy\u2014their desire to have a \u201cworld-class military by the middle of the century.\u201d Developing world-class nuclear forces may be part of that larger effort, which would take place regardless of the actions of the Trump or Biden administration. Jackson is correct that the United States should be working harder to find ways to  cooperate and compete with China  in nonmilitary arenas. But he presents Washington as busied \u201cwith new arms sales and expanding its force posture\u201d as China has become an economic giant\u2014as if China weren\u2019t also selling arms and dramatically altering the military balance in the region while it did so. China, like the United States, has the ability to walk and chew gum at the same time. Washington is finally coming to recognize the looming danger that an aggressive and increasingly powerful techno-authoritarian Chinese regime poses to the region and the world and is taking action accordingly. Failing to recognize this danger and to pursue appropriate responses would increase the chance of conflict by making it more likely that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party will someday decide that the military balance of power has tipped in their favor\u2014and that they should take advantage of the shift by resorting to force. THOMAS SHUGART is\u00a0 an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Center for a New American Security. He served for over 25 years as a submarine warfare officer in the U.S. Navy, where he last worked in the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s Office of Net Assessment. Thomas Shugart dismisses the idea that Washington\u2019s adversaries might react to its overmilitarized foreign policy in undesirable ways. His critique compiles minor complaints that misrepresent what I wrote and also fail to refute my argument. The larger point that Shugart misses is that U.S. policy in Asia remains on the wrong side of trends that adversely impact both regional security and U.S. interests. He appears to be primarily concerned with ensuring that Washington receives no \u201cblame\u201d for Asia being awash in militarism, and he shows little interest in having the United States improve an increasingly  precarious situation  in Asia.  Shugart mostly quibbles with my choice of words rather than challenge the claims I advance. For instance, I describe the broad trend of Washington \u201csurging troops and military hardware into the region\u201d and then detail precisely what I mean over the course of several paragraphs. Shugart ignores my description in favor of telling the reader how many troops the United States positions in Asia. This does not refute my argument, as the surge of militarism I describe has taken place over the course of several years and is as much about hardware and bases as it is about personnel. Disputing the rate of change and whether rotational forces or weapons systems count as \u201csurging\u201d litigates a gerund rather than addressing the actual posture and force structure changes I describe in my essay. Moreover, Shugart\u2019s figure of 89,000 U.S. troops stationed in the Indo-Pacific\u2014which is a lot in its own right\u2014excludes forces that surge into the region for the many large-scale exercises the United States conducts each year.  Shugart also incorrectly states that I blame President Joe Biden\u2019s administration for Japan\u2019s pursuit of hypersonic missiles. I do not, and my essay makes clear that Biden is the steward of a bad trend that predates him. I do not state that the administration initiated the development, as Shugart suggests.  In response to my cataloging of Washington\u2019s many new   military initiatives over the past several years, Shugart rationalizes these programs by writing that they aim to \u201ccounter China\u2019s growing military threat.\u201d Of course they do. He states this as a rebuttal, yet I say explicitly that the United States justifies its litany of changes to the U.S. force posture in response to China\u2019s military modernization. My problem with it is that it reflects poor judgment.   As Asia\u2019s military hegemon, the United States has a hand in shaping the trends that endanger the region. On the issue of U.S. nuclear forces, Shugart argues that former President Donald Trump\u2019s gratuitous nuclear plans were actually former President Barack Obama\u2019s policies. This is not entirely correct and is in any case irrelevant. During the Obama administration, the Pentagon did draw up nuclear modernization plans that Trump inherited. (I worked there at the time.) But Trump\u2019s nuclear-related budget submissions expanded the Obama-era nuclear agenda. Even so, Biden\u2019s nuclear policies are no more vindicated by assertions that they date to the Obama era than that they date to the Trump era. I care about the consequences of U.S. actions, not their genealogy. \u00a0 Here again, Shugart shadowboxes with my diction rather than my analysis. I characterized U.S. nuclear modernization many times in my essay and toggled between describing it as \u201cmodernization\u201d and \u201cexpansion\u201d for the sake of variety, but both terms are accurate. Shugart seizes on the word \u201cexpansion\u201d to point out that the number of long-range nuclear-capable missile launchers that the United States possesses is not increasing. But I never said it was. What\u2019s expanding is the lethality and cost (and opportunity costs) of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.  But even if all of these misleading complaints were valid, they do not amount to a defense of current U.S. policies or their military-first character. As Asia\u2019s military hegemon, the United States has a hand in shaping the trends that endanger the region. For politicians, American exceptionalism means never having to acknowledge Washington\u2019s complicity in bad outcomes. Analysts, however, can\u2019t afford to be so myopic.\u00a0 \u00a0 Shugart aligns himself with what I see as America\u2019s militarist drift without specifying how U.S. efforts to \u201ccounter\u201d China\u2019s military modernization with more missiles, ships, and nuclear weapons help anything. And he neglects to address the concern that takes up the final third of my essay: the idea that an obsession with military strategy distracts from what actually threatens Asia. Gross economic inequalities, environmental degradation, and the devastation wrought by the pandemic are what Asians most worry about and what threaten to sow the seeds of future military conflict. Shugart\u2019s failure to acknowledge, much less address, these problems reflects the very obsession with military affairs that my essay sought to highlight. In this sense, he inadvertently makes my point. The Pentagon has warped analysts\u2019 ability to contemplate statecraft beyond defense policy. The totality of Shugart\u2019s criticisms fails to refute my case that the U.S. approach to Asia is  overmilitarized . Shugart declines to propose any particular way of seeing or understanding China. And if his assumptions about the intrinsic goodness of American power become a basis for U.S. policy, the region will face a grim future.

bribes to get business overseas.\u201d That was the startling argument U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly made in 2017 about the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits companies from paying bribes abroad. \u201cEvery other country goes into these places and they do what they have to do,\u201d Trump had previously complained. If foreign firms could pay bribes for business, why did the law prevent U.S. firms from doing so? Equally problematic, in Trump\u2019s view, was the FCPA\u2019s role in furthering the United States\u2019 status as \u201cpoliceman of the world.\u201d \u201cWhat are we doing prosecuting people to keep China honest?\u201d he asked during a 2012 television interview. Years later, Trump\u2019s queries have unexpected relevance. As president, Trump tried to weaken the enforcement of the FCPA. Now President Joe Biden has reversed course and formally designated foreign bribery\u2014traditionally a regulatory and criminal issue\u2014a national security concern. Combating corruption, Biden recently declared, \u201cis not just good governance. It is self-defense.\u201d At the G-7 this past June, Biden successfully enlisted key allies to declare that corruption threatens the stability and security of societies and to pledge strengthened multilateral efforts to \u201cdeny safe haven to corrupt individuals\u201d and their ill-gotten gains. He repeated this commitment to root out corruption last month at the United Nations General Assembly. These statements reflect a set of values that the Biden administration is eager to showcase as a contrast to the Trump era. Yet they also highlight an increasingly bipartisan foreign policy focus: the global competition over infrastructure, an area where corruption is endemic. In particular, few developments better explain the United States\u2019 newfound focus on foreign bribery than China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which many view as the country\u2019s  attempt to expand its influence  across the globe. With enormous capacity and capital, China now threatens to dominate the global race for building ports, railways, and telecommunications networks. And while the United States is no saint when it comes to corporate bribery, many policymakers have alleged that China is even more egregious in \u201cexport[ing] corruption skillfully and aggressively\u201d There are two main ways for the United States and its partners to push back. One is to outshine the BRI by offering more attractive and socially responsible infrastructure investments, as the G-7 promised to do. In the short term, however, the United States appears to be pursuing a second strategy: leveling the playing field. Instead of making U.S. bribes legal, as Trump wished, the U.S. government is increasingly eager to criminally prosecute Chinese actors who compete unfairly. Much of this activity has come, in both the Trump and Biden administrations, under the Justice Department\u2019s so-called China Initiative\u2014an ongoing law enforcement effort that presents a new front in the United States\u2019 intensifying competition with China. FBI Director Christopher Wray has confirmed the existence of over 2,000 China-associated investigations. And while many of these cases relate to intellectual property theft or espionage, one of the initiative\u2019s current objectives is to \u201cidentify Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) cases involving Chinese companies that compete with American businesses.\u201d Despite the practical obstacles in doing so\u2014from thorny jurisdictional issues to the difficulty of obtaining legal assistance from Beijing\u2014the Justice Department has demonstrated its capacity to pursue Chinese companies and individuals that pay bribes abroad. Focusing on China in this manner has clear appeal for the Biden administration. Yet it also may backfire in ways that undermine antibribery enforcement efforts and improperly politicize the U.S. justice system. It is therefore essential that the Biden administration conduct a full review\u2014and potential reconsideration\u2014of the means and methods by which the United States seeks to combat overseas Chinese corruption via criminal enforcement. The FCPA was created during the Cold War as an instrument of self-regulation. First passed in 1977, the law reflected, among other things, congressional concern that the United States\u2019 image abroad was undermined by the specter of \u201ccorrupt capitalism.\u201d Antibribery enforcement, accordingly, focused on the conduct of American firms, not Soviet ones. Now, the policing of American firms continues. But as the nature of competition has changed, the FCPA has also gained new relevance. Whereas the United States and the Soviet Union competed for influence mostly via foreign aid and military assistance, U.S.-Chinese competition unfolds via the private sector as well. What\u2019s more, the modern-day U.S. and Chinese economies are  far more intertwined  than their U.S. and Soviet predecessors. Many Chinese firms issue securities, maintain offices, operate subsidiaries, and process payments in the United States, which increases the likelihood that they will be vulnerable to U.S. prosecution. Meanwhile, post\u2013Cold War changes to the FCPA have extended its extraterritorial reach to foreign entities whose illegal conduct only tangentially touches U.S. territory. Specifically, Congress amended the FCPA in 1998 to capture \u201cany act in furtherance of\u201d an illegal bribe while in the territory of the United States, regardless of whether the perpetrators were American. That provides an additional hook by which the actions of a Chinese entity or its agents might be subject to an FCPA prosecution. Prosecutors also increasingly rely on other criminal statutes often implicated by bribery (such as money laundering) that have broad extraterritorial reach. Take, for example, the 2018 prosecution of Chi Ping \u201cPatrick\u201d Ho. Ho led the nonprofit arm of a Chinese energy conglomerate known as CEFC, a position that enabled him to pitch the virtues of the BRI at the United Nations and elsewhere. Behind the scenes, Ho also sought to bribe Chadian and Ugandan officials in exchange for oil rights and other business advantages. But Ho made a fatal blunder that ultimately landed him in handcuffs at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. By maintaining a U.S. office and employing U.S. banks to transmit funds, Ho exposed himself to a litany of FCPA and money-laundering charges. The ensuing trial and conviction enabled the Justice Department to disrupt a key BRI-aligned bribery scheme, dealing a blow to the credibility of the BRI and leading to the eventual dissolution of CEFC.\u00a0 Combating Chinese bribery via criminal enforcement\u2014as opposed to political channels\u2014offers some clear advantages for the United States. Chinese executives operating under Beijing\u2019s protection may not especially fear sanctions or civil penalties sought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). But the prospect of prison time is different. Those executives\u2014and their companies\u2014will face a choice: refrain from bribery or avoid American jurisdiction entirely. The intertwining of the U.S. and Chinese economies makes this latter choice difficult. Credible threats of increased FCPA enforcement ensure that Chinese firms cannot reap the benefits of the U.S. market while choosing to ignore its antibribery laws. To avoid the risk of prosecution, Chinese firms engaged in bribery would need to avoid issuing securities to U.S. investors, maintaining U.S. offices, and generally engaging American capital markets. For many Chinese firms, the prospect of sacrificing these economic benefits may prove too costly, deterring them from engaging in foreign bribery altogether. In addition to deterring the \u201csupply side\u201d of Chinese bribery, BRI-focused enforcement may indirectly prevent its \u201cdemand side\u201d equivalent, the officials pocketing the money in exchange for helping China secure a contract. While the FCPA does not address foreign officials who accept bribes, they may still be vulnerable to prosecution for other offenses\u2014such as money laundering. And even if the Justice Department is understandably reluctant to charge foreign officials, merely being implicated in a federal indictment can create serious reputational costs for foreign governments. The Ho case, for example, provoked political scandals in both Chad and Uganda. Each successive bribery expos\u00e9 makes foreign officials more likely to rebuff Chinese bribes for fear of being named in the next U.S. indictment. Beyond that, high-profile FCPA enforcement may spur overseas regulators to raise their game. Foreign law enforcement will be faced with an ultimatum: police BRI bribery or the U.S. Justice Department will.\u00a0 Taking the competition with China to the courtroom raises concerns, however. Most obvious is the prospect of retaliatory prosecutions. Whereas Chinese citizens in the United States generally enjoy the protection of an independent judiciary, foreigners in China have less protection against spurious retaliatory prosecutions. One need only look at China\u2019s response to charges against a senior Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, for U.S. sanctions violations. In the wake of Meng\u2019s detention by Canadian authorities, two Canadian citizens were summarily arrested in China for unspecified charges of \u201cespionage.\u201d They ultimately spent more than 1,000 days languishing in a Chinese prison. Within hours of Meng\u2019s release last month, however, China released the Canadians\u2014suggesting that Beijing was willing to engage in \u201chostage diplomacy\u201d to secure the release of Chinese citizens arrested abroad. Another important risk relates to the impartiality and independence of the U.S. justice system. There is a key difference between allocating more resources to combat foreign bribery in general (which is wholly permissible) and singling out Chinese organizations or individuals for bribery enforcement actions (which is not). If it appears that the Justice Department is selectively targeting Chinese entities, courts may begin to credit defendants\u2019 claims of constitutional violations. But the appearance of selective prosecution is not only a legal issue; it is also a moral and political one. Civil rights groups have already identified well-founded concerns that the China Initiative stigmatizes Asian Americans amid an uptick in hate crimes. China, in turn, has exploited similar sentiments to cast doubt on the fairness of the U.S. justice system. For instance, Chinese state media suggested that the Ho prosecution had been selectively brought to \u201chead off a perceived threat to [American] hegemony.\u201d A prosecutorial focus on China can also create tension with U.S. allies. Article 5 of the 1997 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Convention on Combating Bribery explicitly prohibits the \u201cconsiderations of national economic interest . . . or the identity of the natural or legal persons involved\u201d in bribery enforcement. Indeed, the Justice Department\u2019s China Initiative raised the eyebrows of OECD monitors, several of whom had expressed concern that it \u201cfocuses on China and references the FCPA.\u201d And while the OECD ultimately accepted the China Initiative, national governments may not. Foreign nations may begin to view China-related legal requests coming from the United States as politically motivated, which could create difficulties for evidence gathering and extradition efforts. Separately, prosecuting overseas Chinese bribery cases may hinge on evidence provided by foreign law enforcement and intelligence partners. But the prospect that such information could be used\u2014even indirectly\u2014to publicly charge Chinese defendants could make foreign partners wary of cooperation for fear of compromising sources and methods or angering Beijing. Moreover, publicly accusing foreign officials of accepting Chinese bribes always creates the potential for an international incident\u2014as happened after the Ho indictment when Chad, a key U.S. security partner, blasted Washington for unleashing a \u201cfierce attack against our head of state.\u201d Even officials not directly implicated in Chinese bribery schemes may be reluctant to cooperate with the United States for fear of appearing subservient. If the Biden administration is intent on pursuing Chinese bribery as part of its foreign policy agenda, it should build in safeguards to seek to protect prosecutorial impartiality, reduce damage to international partnerships, and preempt Chinese retaliatory prosecutions. In the first instance, the United States needs to forcefully reaffirm the separation between  law enforcement and politics \u2014a line that was tested repeatedly during the Trump years. In particular, Trump took the extraordinary step of dangling a detained Chinese executive as leverage in trade negotiations. The Biden administration should instead ensure that the White House and other federal agencies adopt the posture of the Justice Department and implement a stricter gag order prohibiting officials from commenting on enforcement matters. Doing so will help assuage concerns that the United States is employing federal prosecutions to obtain geopolitical leverage.\u00a0 Meanwhile the Justice Department, which has long operated on uncodified norms of prosecutorial independence, should build in more formalized safeguards against improper political interference, as Attorney General Merrick Garland has already  begun  to do. It should also publicly clarify how the China Initiative\u2019s policy goals are separated from the independent charging decisions of career prosecutors. Finally, both the Justice Department and the SEC should continue their efforts to ensure the FCPA is robustly enforced against Americans who violate its provisions, which will help deflate claims of selective prosecution against foreign companies.\u00a0 To preempt blowback, the United States should also continue to emphasize multilateral bribery enforcement. While partnering with Chinese regulators is an unlikely prospect, Washington should bolster its existing efforts seek out cooperation from other foreign partners and be willing to step back when local prosecutors are willing to step up. Where countries make good-faith efforts to prosecute Chinese bribery within their own borders, U.S. officials should support those efforts before hauling prized cases off to faraway American courtrooms in support of the China Initiative.\u00a0 Ultimately, the Biden administration needs to weigh whether and when U.S. courts ought to be employed to solve what is chiefly a foreign policy problem. It may be the case that diplomatic olive branches\u2014rather than prosecutorial arrows\u2014are more effective in encouraging foreign leaders to reject BRI bribes. Bringing China to court may blunt some corruption, but it will not address its underlying causes and enablers. For that, the Biden administration will need to look beyond the China Initiative. It will need to continue its efforts to lobby foreign partners to crack down on corruption. It will need to help strengthen the rule of law in countries most vulnerable to bribery solicitation. And it will need to lead by example, by redoubling efforts to root out domestic and overseas corruption enabled by American businesses. But above all, it will need to eventually convince Beijing that the  political costs  of turning a blind eye to its firms\u2019 overseas activities exceed any benefits\u2014with the hope that, ultimately, Chinese firms will be held accountable by Beijing, not Washington.

While partnering with Chinese regulators is an unlikely prospect, Washington should bolster its existing efforts seek out cooperation from other foreign partners and be willing to step back when local prosecutors are willing to step up. Where countries make good-faith efforts to prosecute Chinese bribery within their own borders, U.S. officials should support those efforts before hauling prized cases off to faraway American courtrooms in support of the China Initiative.\u00a0@@Ultimately, the Biden administration needs to weigh whether and when U.S. courts ought to be employed to solve what is chiefly a foreign policy problem. It may be the case that diplomatic olive branches\u2014rather than prosecutorial arrows\u2014are more effective in encouraging foreign leaders to reject BRI bribes. Bringing China to court may blunt some corruption, but it will not address its underlying causes and enablers.@@For that, the Biden administration will need to look beyond the China Initiative. It will need to continue its efforts to lobby foreign partners to crack down on corruption. It will need to help strengthen the rule of law in countries most vulnerable to bribery solicitation. And it will need to lead by example, by redoubling efforts to root out domestic and overseas corruption enabled by American businesses. But above all, it will need to eventually convince Beijing that the @@ of turning a blind eye to its firms\u2019 overseas activities exceed any benefits\u2014with the hope that, ultimately, Chinese firms will be held accountable by Beijing, not Washington.", "download_timeout": 180.0, "download_slot": "www.foreignaffairs.com", "download_latency": 2.6026110649108887, "depth": 0, "status": 200,

Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Get a link Request Reprint Permissions The global tax deal endorsed by world leaders at the recent G-20 meeting in Rome reflects the adage \u201cTo retain tax sovereignty, a state must relinquish it.\u201d This seeming paradox refers to states\u2019 increasing inability to collect tax revenue needed to fund domestic policies unless they work together. For example, the Biden administration knows that global competitive pressures have driven down U.S. corporate tax rates and that loopholes in the international tax system have allowed companies to avoid taxes by shifting their profits abroad. To combat these trends, and to secure funding for its \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan, the Biden administration enlisted international cooperation. The new tax agreement aims to make it harder for companies to escape tax, and it also aims to reduce the global race to the bottom on corporate tax rates.  It does this through two key measures. First, it makes it more difficult for companies to avoid paying taxes in countries where they are making money but have no physical footprint; and second, it introduces a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent. These changes augur a fundamental shift in how international tax works. Until now, multilateral cooperation involved only a few dozen countries\u2014members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)\u2014and only a narrow set of technical issues. The physical presence of a company inside a country determined whether its profits could be taxed there, and the ability to set tax rates was widely viewed as a central aspect of sovereignty that countries should never bargain away. But after nearly a year of intense negotiation, 137 countries representing more than 90 percent of global GDP and almost 75 percent of the world\u2019s population agreed to a deal that would both reduce the international tax system\u2019s dependence on physical presence and introduce a minimum tax rate.  The agreement has rightly been described as groundbreaking, but its full significance will ultimately depend on future developments. First, the deal will confront the reality of domestic politics. And even if countries manage to implement it, the deal is unlikely to emerge unchanged. Enacting and enforcing the new rules will also require an unprecedented level of international cooperation\u2014and likely a multilateral treaty. Finally, and most important, the significance of the deal depends on what happens next; although the current deal is relatively narrow in scope, it could grow, generating more tax revenue for the countries that need it most. Not Keeping Up With the Times The impetus for the deal came from fiscal and political woes of the 2008 financial crisis. Revelations of aggressive tax avoidance by tech companies and the COVID-19 pandemic increased pressure on governments. Countries grew frustrated with the century-old tax treaty framework that divides the income of multinationals among states for tax purposes. Increasingly obsolete, the treaties rely too much on where companies are physically located versus other factors, such as where their customers are. As the digital economy grew, a severe disconnect developed between where companies earn income and where they pay tax.  Targeting Big Tech, three dozen countries, including most prominently France, enacted novel digital taxes to recapture some of the revenue that existing tax treaties prevented them from collecting as the economy digitized. The United States, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, cried foul, arguing that the new taxes violated tax treaties and unfairly targeted U.S. firms. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative launched an investigation of the French digital tax and concluded that the United States was justified in applying retaliatory tariffs.  The U.S. threat to retaliate with tariffs on French wines and luxury products led to an impasse. France and other treaty partners agreed to remove their digital taxes, but only if the United States would renegotiate tax treaties. After beginning negotiations, the Trump administration used the COVID-19 crisis as an excuse to pause them, perhaps hoping that countries would be too distracted to follow through. But the pandemic\u2019s revenue crunch\u2014and Big Tech\u2019s outsize COVID-19 profits\u2014ensured that digital taxes remained at the top of countries\u2019 agendas. It was not until the Biden administration took office that the United States was truly open to negotiation. Seeking revenue to fund its domestic agenda, the Biden team hoped to tie digital taxes to the larger question of coordinated corporate tax rates. Who Gets to Tax the World\u2019s Most Profitable Companies?   The arrangement reached on digital taxes gets less attention than the minimum tax but is no less radical. In a first step, the deal identifies the companies to which it applies\u2014those with global turnover above 20 billion euros and profitability of over ten percent. The idea was to apply the deal only to the world\u2019s biggest and most profitable companies. For these\u2014roughly 100\u2014companies, the deal identified a slice of profits to be reallocated among the countries according to where the company has sales. For example, under current tax treaties, if Facebook had no physical presence in France, then France would not be entitled to tax Facebook on its profits, even though Facebook has over 30 million users in France. In contrast, under the new deal, even without a physical presence, France would be able to tax a certain portion of Facebook\u2019s profits. Although details have not been finalized, how much France would be able to tax will depend on the share of Facebook\u2019s global sales\u2014for example, its ad sales\u2014that take place in France. For the slice of corporate profits subject to this new rule, the deal completely changes how  international taxation  of business profits works by severing the connection between tax and physical presence. Because the deal was not meant to result in substantial new taxes for companies, however, it also means that although market countries would gain revenue, other countries\u2014including companies\u2019 home countries\u2014would have to give up revenue.  Some countries wanted this proposal\u2014like the digital taxes it would replace\u2014to apply only to  Big Tech . Focusing the tax narrowly would, they hoped, limit its burden to the U.S. tech companies that dominated the sector. But negotiators for the United States deftly navigated the process to ensure that the trigger for the new tax was based on profitability, not sector. This policy shift spread the tax hit across more industries and the revenue loss across more countries. Still, the current proposal will affect mostly U.S. and Chinese companies engaged in Big Pharma, Big Tech, and retail.   \u201cAlthough the deal is narrow in scope, it signals a profound shift in international tax.\u201d Ultimately, the result of the reallocation deal, if implemented, will depend on at least three factors outside the exclusive control of the United States. First is the behavioral response: how much revenue gets reallocated (and where) will depend on how good companies become at manipulating the new rules\u2014which, in turn, will depend on how those rules are written. Second is the stability of the agreement. It will take time to see whether other countries actually repeal\u2014and do not reinstate\u2014popular, easy-to-administer, and revenue-productive digital taxes. Third is the scope. States already plan to widen the deal to include more companies after seven years, and further expansion after that is possible. Right now, the deal would affect only about 100 companies, and the OECD estimates that once enacted, it would reallocate $125 billion in profits.  U.S. officials claim that the revenue effect for the United States will be close to neutral\u2014although the United States would relinquish tax entitlement owing to its status as the home country to many of the affected companies, it would also gain new entitlements to tax owing to its enormous consumer market. But if the scope of this deal were to expand over time, it could ultimately bring a sweeping redistribution of tax entitlements, dramatically increasing revenue for developing countries, especially those with large consumer markets.  France and the United States were the most prominent combatants in the fight over how to tax Big Tech, but framing the dispute exclusively as one between a tech company\u2019s home country (often the United States) and a country where many of its users or consumers reside is misleading. Under current law, it is often the case that, through savvy tax-planning techniques, a company can avoid taxes in both its home state  and the country where its consumers reside.  Instead, profits are reported in tax havens or nowhere at all. Thus, under the current paradigm, France\u2019s tax loss does not necessarily amount to a current tax gain for the United States. Instead, companies park their profits in a low-tax country such as Ireland.  Fighting Tax Havens  To further weaken the incentive to move profits to low-tax countries, the second part of the deal imposes a 15 percent minimum tax on a small number of extremely high-revenue companies, namely those with annual revenue in excess of 750 million euros. The minimum tax provides for what might be called a \u201c fiscal fail-safe \u201d: a set of rules that trigger special additional tax whenever a taxpayer is deemed to have paid an insufficient amount. For example, if a German company did not pay tax of at least 15 percent on its income abroad, the fiscal fail-safe would be triggered, and Germany could top up the tax to reach 15 percent.  The deal makes the minimum tax optional. Countries do not have to adopt it, but those that choose to do so have committed to enact the minimum tax in a coordinated fashion, and even countries that will not themselves implement the fiscal fail-safe have agreed to accommodate the application of the minimum tax by other states. Because the country where a company has its headquarters serves as a kind of tax authority of last resort under the deal, only a few key countries have to adopt the minimum tax for it to apply broadly.  On minimum taxation, the world again moved collectively, and with precision, against a small number of companies perceived to be a prominent source of the tax-dodging problem. But although the deal explicitly targets companies, it also implicitly goes after low-tax countries, seeking to neutralize the allure of tax havens.  The minimum tax rate will be more effective if more states adopt it, and much will depend on the precise rules\u2014yet to be determined\u2014and whether they are stringent enough to prevent manipulation by tax planners inside affected companies. Most important, the minimum tax involves a gamble. Countries supporting it hope that raising the world\u2019s floor rate from today\u2019s (implicit) zero percent to 15 percent will afford states the opportunity to raise their national corporate tax rates well above 15 percent if they wish. But as countries compete to attract multinationals, 15 percent may end up serving as a convergence rate, under which lower rates rise until they reach 15 percent but higher rates also decline until they reach 15 percent. This would make 15 percent not only a floor but also effectively a ceiling.  How It Plays at Home  U.S. Treasury officials used these negotiations to advance purely domestic goals. For example, to fund its spending proposals, the  Biden administration  planned to dramatically increase U.S. corporate tax rates. The administration actively supported the minimum tax deal with the expectation that it would help convince Congress to agree to large rate increases, including increases well in excess of the agreed global minimum. But Democrats in Congress partially rejected President Joe Biden\u2019s rate hikes, citing the need to remain competitive with other countries. Although there are still meaningful corporate tax increases pending before Congress, time will tell whether 15 percent represents the floor the Biden administration hoped it would or whether it effectively represents a convergence rate. \u00a0 Meanwhile,   Republicans have charged the  Biden administration  with accepting concessions regarding the taxation of U.S. digital companies to secure a higher minimum tax rate.   For example, Republicans decried the failure of the United States to secure an immediate cessation of digital taxation upon conclusion of the deal, rather than upon implementation of the deal. As things stand, the United States and several western European countries have signed a  statement of intent  that says once the reallocation rules are in place, digital taxes will be refunded to the extent that they exceed what would have been collected under the new reallocation rule. This side deal enables the Biden administration to apply pressure to members of Congress to implement the global tax deal, but unless and until Congress agrees, Big Tech will continue to face digital tax abroad.  \u201cThe new deal introduces dizzying complexity into an international system that already had more than its fair share.\u201d European countries also used the OECD forum to secure domestic political objectives. Perceiving themselves as victims of profit shifting by U.S. multinationals and victims of tax poaching by low-tax European states, the high-tax countries of Europe, especially France and Germany, have long pushed for action within Europe. But an EU proposal to tax the digital behemoths failed when low-tax Ireland, among others, voted against it. Likewise, legislative proposals to harmonize corporate taxes within the EU have failed to win consensus. Because every EU member state has a tax veto, the barriers to tax legislation in the EU are especially high. France and Germany hoped that bringing the digital-tax and tax-coordination issues to the larger forum of the OECD\u2019s so-called Inclusive Framework of 141 countries would help pressure the smaller EU holdouts.  This strategy worked, at least in part. All of the EU member states signed on to the OECD deal, which presumably means that they will now agree to the EU implementing legislation. Ireland in particular faced pressure from the United States, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visiting the country in the days before the deal was announced. But the need to gain acquiescence by the EU holdouts gave those countries an outsize voice in the negotiations. Ireland agreed to the minimum tax only on the condition that the rate would be no higher than 15 percent, and on the eve of the deal\u2019s announcement, Hungary and Estonia\u2014countries with the lowest tax rates in the EU\u2014negotiated a long extension of a carve-out from the deal. It remains to be seen whether these last minute concessions made to low-tax EU countries translate to yes votes in the EU Council. \u00a0 What\u2019s in It for Developing Countries? For most of its history, the OECD has been a small club of rich countries setting global tax standards. But in 2013, well before the current tax deal, the G-20 appointed the OECD to lead an effort to close corporate tax loopholes. In addition to bringing the G-20 countries that were not OECD members to the bargaining table, the OECD established the Inclusive Framework, which now stands at 141 members, and it was this body that ended up negotiating the current global tax deal.  Despite this new inclusivity, it is not clear how effectively developing countries were able to participate in the negotiations. Researchers  explained  that the pace and intensity of the work made it difficult for smaller, less resourced countries to take part. Some of the barriers\u2014such as the time and cost of travel to the OECD in Paris\u2014were reduced by electronic meetings necessitated by the pandemic. Meanwhile, developing country tax administrators, including those represented by technical experts from the African Tax Administration Forum, repeatedly advocated for tax simplification, but those arguments largely went unheeded.   Instead, the new deal introduces dizzying complexity into an international system that already had more than its fair share. This complexity raises concerns about whether the developing countries that signed on will have the resources to administer it. In other areas, developing countries were able to successfully advocate for their interests. For example, the reallocation part of the deal involves a two-tiered sales threshold. Large economies will not be able to tax foreign companies unless those companies have at least one million euros of sales in their jurisdictions. Countries with a GDP of less than 40 billion euros, however, will be able to do so as long as the foreign company has 250,000 euros in sales there. But it is unclear how much developing countries will benefit even considering the lower threshold because they will\u2014like all countries signing on to the deal\u2014be expected to abandon simple-to-administer digital taxes that raise significant revenue. Developing countries likely will have to wait until the reallocation part of the agreement expands to include more companies before they see big influxes of new revenue.  Endorsing Cooperation Overall, although the deal is narrow in scope, it signals a profound shift in international tax. Over the last decade, international tax diplomacy has become more multilateral and more inclusive. Perhaps ironically, the OECD, an organization long criticized for its exclusivity and rich-country bias, has managed to position itself as a forum serving not just its 38 official members but the 141 members of the Inclusive Framework. The dramatic expansion of the ambit of the OECD\u2014in terms of the types of issues negotiated and, effectively, in membership\u2014as well as its selection as a forum for the current negotiation over, for example, the more inclusive United Nations\u2014reflects not only the opportunism and savvy of the OECD\u2019s leadership but the sense among countries that results were urgently needed. Countries\u2019 recent experience with large-scale tax cooperation may even embolden the OECD to take on more. Indeed, the next big project is shaping up to be  carbon taxation .  The recent negotiations also confirmed a new paradigm in which the United States has less influence over international tax. States have proved themselves willing to depart from international consensus\u2014and arguably to breach their tax treaties with the United States\u2014to enact unilateral rules when the old way of doing things becomes obsolete. Digital taxes are just one example, and they brought an otherwise reluctant United States to the bargaining table.  Still, working within this new paradigm, U.S. negotiators managed to secure a reallocation deal that is significantly better than what it faced under unilateral digital taxes, as well as an agreement on minimum taxation, a Biden administration priority. More generally, the global tax deal reflects the view that tax cooperation is worthwhile. Only four of the Inclusive Framework countries involved in the negotiations did not sign on: Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. To secure the deal, all countries made compromises. For example, to prevent a tit-for-tat trade war on digital tax, countries promised the United States that they would refund digital taxes once the new allocation rule was in place. In turn, the United States agreed to forestall retaliatory tariffs. Likewise, to ensure the collection of a minimum amount of tax, the countries relinquished control\u2014to some extent\u2014over tax rates. In each case, countries can be understood to have ceded national tax sovereignty in an international forum in order to achieve domestic objectives.  Embodying the paradox that to preserve tax sovereignty states must relinquish it, the tax deal represents the hope that by modernizing the international tax system and coordinating corporate rates to dampen tax competition, states can raise the revenue they need for domestic priorities. But international agreements, however well intended, do not by themselves translate to domestic approval or effective implementation. Domestic politics will no doubt change the deal in ways that cannot yet be seen. Countries may find that rather than allowing them to escape the vicissitudes of domestic politics, international cooperation intensifies them.

The United States and the European Union are among each other\u2019s largest trading partners, as well as the largest source and destination for their companies\u2019 foreign investments. Decades of policy cooperation have resulted in remarkable economic interdependence, job growth, and expanding investment. Take, for example, the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines on either side of the Atlantic. Over one hundred million Americans have received doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab, a vaccine based on European innovation and made at Pfizer\u2019s plants in Massachusetts, Michigan, and Missouri; a similar number of Europeans have received the same vaccine made at Pfizer\u2019s facility in Belgium. Moderna\u2019s messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine was invented in the United States; it is also being bottled for distribution in plants in France and Spain and has become increasingly essential for the EU\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was co-developed at the Janssen R & D lab in the Netherlands and a hospital in Boston and is also produced on both sides of the ocean. Unfortunately, the success stories of interdependence don\u2019t get the same attention as the friction. The imperatives of domestic politics encourage leaders to assail foreign targets and dwell on asymmetries. European officials bristle at the actions of U.S. technology giants Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google (there are no comparable European companies), while their U.S. counterparts worry that Americans are buying too many German cars and that Europe refuses to accept genetically modified farm products from the Midwest. The inordinate focus on such bilateral irritants has had damaging consequences. The United States and the EU have ignored the decline in their combined influence over global trade. The two made up over 50 percent of global exports in 1990; by 2020, that had fallen to roughly 40 percent. Such a decline need not be a bad thing, except that it largely reflects the growing economic power of China, which does not share their transparent, rules-based, nondiscriminatory, and market-oriented approach to international commerce. Beijing\u2019s increasingly opaque, nonmarket, and economically coercive style is mounting a challenge to the trading system and multilateral order that the United States and Europe developed together over the last 75 years. This concern should motivate Americans and Europeans to get out of their own way. In late September, U.S. and European Union officials met in Pittsburgh to try to patch up their differences on trade. Four years of Trump administration policy had left ties strained and in need of restoration. Both the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden and the European Commission under its current president, Ursula von der Leyen, hope to rebuild transatlantic cooperation in areas as varied as  climate change , digital transformation, workers, technology, supply chain resilience, and human rights, all under the rubric of trade. But as the uncertain outcome of the Pittsburgh summit suggests, strengthening transatlantic ties in the age of an assertive China could be the most difficult trade task these two longtime collaborators have ever taken on. The recent struggles in U.S.-EU trade go back at least as far as the second term of the Obama administration. At the time, the United States and the EU attempted to circumvent an insurmountable impasse in global talks under the auspices of the World Trade Organization. In early 2013, they launched the ambitious bilateral initiative known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The TTIP aimed not just to strengthen transatlantic trade ties but also to encourage greater foreign direct investment and regulatory cooperation. But it foundered in the rocky shoals of politics. The revelations in 2013 that the United States had allegedly been spying on German Chancellor Angela Merkel had devastating consequences for U.S. relations with Germany, a necessary trade advocate. Separately, European civil society quickly mobilized against the TTIP itself. Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Berlin and other European capitals, stoking fears that giant U.S. corporations would use the agreement to gut Europe\u2019s hard-fought consumer and environmental protections. Negotiations never reached the finish line, and the deal died quietly under its own weight. Transatlantic trade relations deteriorated further under the administration of President Donald Trump. Its \u201cAmerica first\u201d policies prioritized attacking partners with whom the United States \u201csuffered\u201d bilateral trade deficits. Less than 100 days into his administration, Trump kicked off an investigation into steel imports under a Korean War\u2013era law that allowed the government to impose import tariffs in the name of defending national security. NATO allies warned Washington of the consequences of such a move, but Trump nevertheless imposed duties on European steel and aluminum in June 2018. (Brussels immediately retaliated, as promised.) The tariffs in and of themselves were not new\u2014European companies had dealt with U.S. steel protections for decades\u2014but their imposition under a national security law rankled the Europeans. How could Washington treat its NATO allies as security threats? Trump quickly used the same law to threaten even more duties on billions of dollars of BMWs, Mercedes-Benzes, and Volkswagens. In July, tensions reached such a pitch that European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker rushed to Washington, and both parties agreed to launch negotiations over what could have turned into another one of Trump\u2019s minor trade deals. The EU also promised to buy more American soybeans and liquefied natural gas, allowing Trump to claim a political victory. But by the time his administration got around to asking Congress for formal permission to negotiate with Brussels, it was clear these talks would go nowhere. Congress wanted the negotiations to include European restrictions on U.S. farm exports, but the commission had no mandate from member states to negotiate over agriculture, let alone the political appetite to engage with Trump. There were talks for almost a year, but nothing was agreed apart from a very modest deal to abolish tariffs on lobsters and ceramics. \u00a0 The Trump administration also hurt EU and U.S. interests by dismantling the World Trade Organization\u2019s system for resolving disputes by refusing to appoint arbitrators to a key appeals body. Since the mid-1990s, Brussels and Washington had leaned heavily on the WTO to manage their bilateral trade tensions. Brussels decided it had had enough when the Trump administration went around the WTO process for the first time in decades to threaten tariffs in response to France\u2019s imposition of a digital services tax on U.S. technology firms in December 2019. The Europeans suddenly felt the need for protection not just from the likes of China and  Russia \u2014but also from the United States. Trump\u2019s defeat in the November 2020 U.S. election offered a fresh start. Brussels quickly sought to capitalize on Joe Biden\u2019s campaign pledge to \u201cwork with allies.\u201d In early December, the EU offered up a new and detailed blueprint for transatlantic trade and technology cooperation that also signaled it was coming around on some of Washington\u2019s key concerns, including those regarding  China . But then Brussels miscalculated. Later that month, the European Commission surprised the world by announcing a bilateral investment agreement with Beijing. The Biden team\u2014now in transition mode and unable to speak directly to their European counterparts until it assumed power on January 20\u2014was left furious. All that Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s choice for national security adviser, could do was  tweet , and the Americans were left wondering: Was Europe a willing partner after all? To be sure, there have been some positive signs since Biden assumed office. In March, the United States and the EU implemented coordinated sanctions over China\u2019s alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Janet Yellen, Biden\u2019s choice for Treasury secretary, has shepherded discussions surrounding global corporate tax reform to wide applause in many European capitals. (The progress on this front has allowed the United States to back off from imposing retaliatory tariffs on European digital services taxes.) The two sides also decided to settle the decades-long rancor over their respective subsidies to aeronautics firms Boeing and Airbus. Finally, Brussels delayed imposing a scheduled round of retaliatory tariffs against Trump\u2019s steel tariffs until December, with recent  reports  suggesting a more durable negotiated settlement to the problem may be in the offing. But the biggest boost was the announcement made during Biden\u2019s June visit to Europe of a summit that would establish the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, or TTC. This council would serve as the means to launch a new era of transatlantic policy cooperation. The TTC remains inchoate even after the recent summit in Pittsburgh, but both sides agree that it will not be a rehash of the failed Obama-era TTIP. Officials steered clear of controversial topics, such as investor-state dispute settlement\u2014the controversial special court proposed in the TTIP that sparked protests across Europe\u2014the United States\u2019 genetically modified foods, or even tariff reductions. Instead, they were intent on  prioritizing  new and immediate areas for collaboration. Ten working groups covered a range of important topics, including artificial intelligence, 5G, and pharmaceutical supply chains. One area of particular concern to both sides is the current global shortage of semiconductors, which has badly affected automobile industries. The United States and the EU are both now attempting to direct tens of billions of dollars to boost domestic production of these chips to better compete with the likes of South Korea and Taiwan, as well as with China, which is also ramping up funding of this sector. The United States and the EU agreed to coordinate their semiconductor subsidies so that they don\u2019t simply drive up the bill for American and European taxpayers by chasing the same firms and segments of the market. On artificial intelligence, the United States and the EU committed to work together to develop guardrails that promote innovation but also make sure the technology is used responsibly, with respect for shared values and human rights. But this agreement went only so far. Both sides may be concerned that authoritarian regimes might abuse artificial intelligence by using it for unlawful surveillance and \u201csocial scoring\u201d of individuals, but they are yet to agree to any sort of joint framework or common standards to regulate the technology. The risk is that these discussions about artificial intelligence turn into exchanges of ideas bereft of any concrete commitments, even as both the United States and the EU fall behind a China that has made significant investments in the field. Trade ties will also need to accommodate climate policy now that the Biden administration has rejoined the Paris agreement. Brussels rolled out a carbon border adjustment mechanism in July that would tax foreign exports of carbon-intensive products from countries that themselves do not implement a domestic carbon tax. This current proposal could hurt U.S. exports to Europe, simply because the United States may choose to reach its climate objectives through a mix of regulations and subsidies and not through carbon taxation. U.S. and EU officials can use the new trade council to better understand and support each other\u2019s approaches to meeting their overall carbon-reduction targets and not let minor differences in strategy mushroom into trade conflicts. The Pittsburgh summit did not produce many immediate results, but that was to be expected. The two sides did commit to set up routine meetings for ministers and a framework for staff to tackle issues before they escalate into larger political problems. Policy mistakes happen in the absence of communication. During the Trump administration, senior U.S. officials were so fixated on the trade war with China that they often stood up visiting EU trade delegations. As a refreshing contrast, Katherine Tai, Biden\u2019s U.S. trade representative, has famously emphasized the need for U.S. policymakers \u201cto walk, chew gum, and play chess at the same time.\u201d China did come up in Pittsburgh, of course, albeit obliquely. The 6,000-word joint statement released after the summit was largely about China but did not mention the country once. Brussels had been worried the council would turn into an unproductive, China-bashing exercise, simply another plank of the U.S. trade war. For its part, Washington had been concerned that the EU may still be refusing to treat seriously the threat posed by China. The United States would do well to heed the European view that obsession with China will lead to policy mistakes. Many European countries have navigated the pitfalls of state-centered capitalism; European policymakers may have a finer sense of which Chinese policies will be better off left to fail on their own rather than provoke overreaction in Washington and Brussels to the detriment of the transatlantic alliance. The United States and Europe will not always see eye to eye. Tensions in other areas flared after the June announcement of the TTC, with transatlantic disagreements over the handling of the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan, travel restrictions due to the pandemic, and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which brings Russian gas to Germany. A September spat between Washington and Paris over the United States\u2019 submarine deal with Australia nearly scuttled the Pittsburgh meeting altogether. The council needs to become a flexible institution that can manage these sorts of transatlantic strains. In so doing, it can provide the United States and the EU with the impetus to collaborate on shared global challenges that neither can tackle alone.

As a refreshing contrast, Katherine Tai, Biden\u2019s U.S. trade representative, has famously emphasized the need for U.S. policymakers \u201cto walk, chew gum, and play chess at the same time.\u201d@@China did come up in Pittsburgh, of course, albeit obliquely. The 6,000-word joint statement released after the summit was largely about China but did not mention the country once. Brussels had been worried the council would turn into an unproductive, China-bashing exercise, simply another plank of the U.S. trade war. For its part, Washington had been concerned that the EU may still be refusing to treat seriously the threat posed by China. The United States would do well to heed the European view that obsession with China will lead to policy mistakes. Many European countries have navigated the pitfalls of state-centered capitalism; European policymakers may have a finer sense of which Chinese policies will be better off left to fail on their own rather than provoke overreaction in Washington and Brussels to the detriment of the transatlantic alliance.@@The United States and Europe will not always see eye to eye. Tensions in other areas flared after the June announcement of the TTC, with transatlantic disagreements over the handling of the U.S. pullout from Afghanistan, travel restrictions due to the pandemic, and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which brings Russian gas to Germany. A September spat between Washington and Paris over the United States\u2019 submarine deal with Australia nearly scuttled the Pittsburgh meeting altogether. The council needs to become a flexible institution that can manage these sorts of transatlantic strains. In so doing, it can provide the United States and the EU with the impetus to collaborate on shared global challenges that neither can tackle alone.", "download_timeout": 180.0, "download_slot":

operations. A dramatic surge in ransomware attacks has targeted such critical national infrastructure as the Colonial Pipeline\u2014which was shut down for six days in May, disrupting fuel supplies to 17 states\u2014and halted the operation of thousands of American schools, businesses, and hospitals. The hacking of SolarWinds Orion software, which compromised the data of hundreds of major companies and government agencies and went undiscovered for at least eight months, demonstrated that even the best-resourced organizations remain vulnerable to malign actors. While the motley crew of cybercriminals and state-sponsored hackers who constitute the offense has not yet widely adopted artificial intelligence techniques, many AI capabilities are accessible with few restrictions. If traditional cyberattacks begin to lose their effectiveness, the offense won\u2019t hesitate to reach for AI-enabled ones to restore its advantage\u2014evoking worst-case future scenarios in which AI-enabled agents move autonomously through networks, finding and exploiting vulnerabilities at unprecedented speed. Indeed, some of the most damaging global cyberattacks, such as the 2017 NotPetya attack, incorporated automated techniques, just not AI ones. These approaches rely on prescriptive, rules-based techniques, and lack the ability to adjust tactics on the fly, but can be considered the precursors of fully automated, \u201cintelligent\u201d agent\u2013led attacks. Yet it is not just cyberattackers who stand to benefit from AI. Machine learning and other AI techniques are beginning to bolster  cyberdefense  efforts as well, although not yet at the scale necessary to alter the advantage the offense presently enjoys. There is reason to hope that AI will become a game-changer for the defense. As offense and defense both race to leverage AI techniques, the question is which side will manage to benefit most. There is currently limited evidence that hackers have begun making significant use of AI techniques. This is not particularly surprising. Current techniques are highly effective, and adding AI to the mix could be an unnecessary complication. And while cyber and AI skill sets overlap to some degree, they are distinct enough that additional expertise is required to build and integrate AI techniques for cyberhacking. If cyberdefenses improve sufficiently, however, the offense may be forced to explore new approaches. An individual or organization could also develop AI-enhanced cyber-tools that are simple to use, reducing the cost and level of expertise required to apply them. There is precedent for this. Some hackers, after discovering a vulnerability, sometimes release proof-of-concept code that is quickly weaponized and diffused through the hacker community. Given the open nature of AI research, there is little to prevent a similar diffusion of AI-enhanced cyberattack tools. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the defense, machine learning is already benefiting specific cybersecurity tasks. A strength of machine learning is its ability to recognize patterns in large data sets. Algorithms similar to the ones that classify objects or recommend online purchases can be employed to detect suspicious activity on networks. The application of machine-learning techniques to traditional intrusion detection systems has undoubtedly already helped to thwart many attacks. For the rather mundane task of spam email detection, for example, machine learning has offered qualitative improvements. More recently, deep-learning facial recognition algorithms have allowed the authentication of users on their mobile devices, mitigating the long-standing cybersecurity problem of weak passwords or personal identification numbers. Vulnerable software and stolen user credentials are the basis of many cyberattacks. Intruders gain a foothold, exploit newly discovered or known vulnerabilities, and repeat the process. For this reason, two areas stand out as important targets for greater research and development investment: automated vulnerability discovery and AI-enabled autonomous cybersecurity. Discovering vulnerabilities has long been an important part of the software development process. Attempts to automate this process are more recent. In 2016, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) hosted the Cyber Grand Challenge, a competition aimed at building fully automated systems capable of detecting and patching vulnerabilities in real time. Although the winning team, Mayhem, demonstrated this potential, they relied heavily on traditional vulnerability discovery tools fine-tuned for the competition; relatively little machine learning was involved. The open question is whether a broader application of AI could discernibly improve current techniques. Many software applications, and operating systems in particular, contain millions of lines of code, making it difficult to detect every potential vulnerability. Automated techniques can help, in the same way that spelling and grammar checkers might help find errors in a long novel, but invariably a skilled human editor must scan every sentence. What has not yet occurred at any scale is the application of AI techniques to remove some of the cognitive workload or to improve upon existing capabilities. While the Cyber Grand Challenge was taking place, another competition was building toward a famous showdown between human and machine. In this second contest, DeepMind, a subsidiary of Google, began building a system to play Go against the world\u2019s best players. The game of Go is notable for having far more potential moves than its Western counterpart, chess. DeepMind\u2019s system, AlphaGo, was in some ways a demonstration of AI\u2019s potential for broader applications. More recently, DeepMind applied AI techniques to the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) competition to determine a protein\u2019s underlying structure. As one prominent researcher described DeepMind\u2019s breakthrough AI program, \u201cThis will change medicine. It will change research. It will change bioengineering. It will change everything.\u201d While AlphaGo was intriguing, AlphaFold provided a means to better understand one of the key building blocks of the human body. Successes such as these across unrelated fields raise hopes that AI may prove similarly useful in the complex endeavor of cyberdefense. However, as impressive as these new AI applications have been, there are no guarantees that it will be possible to develop autonomous cyberdefense agents. For the defense, a potentially potent tool has proved hard to implement across the entire range of cybersecurity-related tasks: threat identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery. Instead, it has been applied more narrowly to specific tasks such as intrusion detection. However, the technology\u2019s potential is too important to ignore. In particular, the threat of autonomous cyber-agents that roam a network, probing for weaknesses and launching attacks, could be devastating if fully realized. Theoretically, attackers could launch thousands or more of these agents at once, wreaking havoc on critical infrastructure and businesses. Will AI techniques enable even more devastating cyberattacks or will they revolutionize cyberdefense? Examining the evolution of cyberdefense operations over the last 30 years provides some clues as to how the integration of cyber and AI may evolve.\u00a0 First, new attack tools will continue to disperse rapidly. The cyber-operations field has traditionally encouraged exploration and experimentation. Many early hacking efforts were simply attempts to bypass controls in order to gain access to more computing resources. Soon, the techniques pioneered by these early hackers entered the mainstream, becoming accessible to users with far more limited expertise. The rapid diffusion of new hacking methods continues to this day. Part of today\u2019s cyber-challenge is that attackers with limited skills can wreak havoc on organizations with sophisticated tools they likely do not fully understand. As new AI tools are developed, they are likely to quickly become available in the same manner. Relatively few people who launch deepfakes understand the underlying AI technology, but thanks to the availability of simple online tools, they can create synthetic video or audio with a few clicks of a mouse. Once offensive AI capabilities are developed, even moderately skilled hackers would be able to leverage them in their attacks.\u00a0 Cyber has proved to be an asymmetric tool of statecraft. China has  leveraged cyber  to engage in the mass theft of intellectual property, thereby shortening the time frame to acquire and use key technologies.  Russia  has used cyber-operations coupled with disinformation campaigns to disrupt the U.S. political process. For cybercriminals, ransomware paired with cryptocurrencies offers an enormously profitable enterprise. If current techniques are foiled, there should be little doubt that states and criminal enterprises will turn to AI. The main reason they still have not leveraged AI capabilities is that they are not yet essential; simpler tools can still do the job. China  has signaled its intent to become the world leader in AI and has been making significant investments in cyber. Since DARPA\u2019s Cyber Grand Challenge, for example, China has held over a dozen competitions focused on automated vulnerability discovery. This dual-use technology can help secure networks or provide new tools to state-sponsored  hackers . China has invested heavily in the education of its cyber-workforce and in the development of a domestic semiconductor industry, and it has repeatedly shown its intent to match U.S. progress in AI. For example, it claims that its new large language model, Wu Dao, is more than ten times as large as GPT-3, the current standard for English-content creation. All of this suggests that China will attempt to leverage new technologies to pursue state policy whenever it can.\u00a0 AI as applied to cyber will be driven by two different imperatives. For the offensive minded, AI tools will be designed to achieve maximum impact. Thus, the offense will seek tools that move fast, gain entry, and accomplish objectives. As NotPetya and other cyberattacks have demonstrated, attackers are often less concerned with controlling their tools than they are with achieving their intended effect. The defense is significantly more constrained. Its priority is defeating attacks while trying to keep networks operational, often at levels above 99 percent. This is a much higher bar. As new capabilities are developed, defenders\u2019 fear of disrupting service may make them reluctant to deploy fully autonomous AI agents, placing them at a disadvantage to their adversaries. Defenders will have to weigh the potential risks of an attack against the impact of shutting down essential services. However, if the offense has fully leveraged AI, greater autonomy for defensive agents may be the only choice. For this reason, a worst-case scenario involves fully autonomous AI cyber-agents. These capabilities differ from present-day autonomous attacks in that offensive cyber-agents would not be reliant on a set of explicit, preprogrammed instructions to guide their activity. Instead, they would be able to adjust their operations in real time, without additional human intervention, based upon the conditions and the opportunities they encounter. Conceivably, these agents could be given an objective without being told how to achieve it. In such a scenario, two of the biggest concerns are speed and control. Theoretically, intelligent agents would be able to move through networks at machine speed. Defensive detection-and-response activities that relied upon human operators would be helpless to react. Perhaps even more concerning is the question of control: Can the effects of an attack be contained after launch? Research has already shown that machine-learning systems can operate in bizarre and unpredictable ways as a result of poorly specified objectives. Previous cyberattacks, starting with the Morris worm in the late 1980s, have occasionally had far greater reach and caused more damage than their creators ever intended. Intelligent agents could be even more devastating, devising novel attack vectors much the way AlphaZero developed new game strategies previously undiscovered by human players. Guarding against even more devastating attacks is just one reason to begin defensive preparations now. Another is that the development of an AI-enabled defensive agent that roams the network looking for illegitimate activity could finally start to tilt the field in favor of the defense. Cyberattacks are already a significant geopolitical threat. Adding AI to this mix makes an already potent tool even more so. Therefore, it is important for network defenders and AI developers to begin working together to develop new defensive AI cyber-capabilities. First, researchers need realistic data sets and network simulations to help the AI systems they build differentiate between threats and normal activity. Much of the available data relies upon public research and development dating from the late 1990s and is not representative of current threats. Armed with more current data sets and simulations, AI developers can begin to explore algorithmic approaches that could enable cyber-agents to detect incursions and, at a minimum, take rudimentary defensive measures. Second, the federal government should prioritize research and development into a full spectrum of  AI-enabled cyberdefenses . As part of these efforts, it should also significantly increase the use of cybersecurity competitions that focus on the development of new AI-enabled security tools. These competitions would differ from those that presently identify and reward the most capable human defender teams. Ideally, these contests would be public and the results would be broadly shared. Organizers should design competitions around specific cybersecurity challenges such as the detection of novel attacks or the identification of anomalous activity. Improvements in automated vulnerability discovery could make software more secure from the outset and find vulnerabilities in software that is already deployed. Competitions should be organized with enough frequency to encourage continued innovation. The 2016 Cyber Grand Challenge undoubtedly helped improve automated vulnerability discovery, but it was held only once. Biyearly competitions with lucrative prizes and a path to government acquisition would incentivize sustained innovation and could uncover promising new techniques. Although Congress has authorized federal agencies to conduct these competitions, their use is sporadic and limited. Conducting more frequent competitions around specific cybersecurity challenges would encourage sustained innovation. The CASP competition for protein folding, which has been held every two years for over 25 years, offers a useful model. Sometimes strategic patience is needed for major breakthroughs. The impact of uncontrolled cyberattacks is becoming ever more costly. It is past time for the United States to explore the potential for AI to improve its cyberdefenses to better protect critical infrastructure providers and state and local governments. There is little reason to believe that strategic competitors will not turn to AI-enabled attacks if traditional techniques lose their effectiveness. The stakes are high, and AI techniques are a double-edged sword. The United States must commit the resources to ensure that it is the defense that benefits.

for COVID-19. Personnel tasked with emergency preparedness held posts at the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the National Security Council. The executive branch had budget authority to supply the Strategic National Stockpile. There was a \u201cpandemic playbook\u201d for dealing with high-consequence infectious diseases. By any measure, though, the federal government botched its response to COVID-19. It mobilized slowly for a disease that was spreading rapidly. It bungled testing, first allowing no one to administer any tests while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to develop its own, and then allowing virtually any vendor to offer tests, without verifying their effectiveness. It allowed U.S. nationals to return to the United States from high-risk areas, and then turned away people arriving from low-risk areas, leaving returning passengers to exchange germs in long lines at unprepared airport points of entry. Federal officials were slow to learn that the Strategic National Stockpile lacked protective equipment, ventilators, and syringes. They were slower still to realize that no one else had them, either\u2014and that the supply chains for procuring more equipment were inflexible and vulnerable. The damage was compounded by singularly inept communication. Even when officials made sound decisions, they often undercut themselves by failing to explain their choices clearly. Their incoherence not only reduced the efficacy of their policies but eroded public trust and confidence, as officials seemingly contradicted themselves or shifted the goalposts. As long as federal officials\u2019 communications are mumbled, confusing, contradictory, incomprehensible, sanctimonious, and disrespectful, they will contribute to the failure of bringing the virus under control. President Joe Biden has done a better job than his predecessor in handling the deadly virus. But poor communication has plagued his administration\u2019s response, as well. To convince the American public to take the necessary steps to combat COVID-19, officials should stop ad hoc messaging and tap the decades of research on risk communication. That research shows policymakers need to provide the scientific evidence supporting their recommendations. Moreover, they need to test their messages to ensure people understand what is being asked of them. That essential step appears to have been skipped during the pandemic, with  disastrous results . Experts often have misguided intuitions about nonexperts\u2019 beliefs and behaviors. As a result, when their messages fail, it is easy and convenient for them to blame their audience as irrational. Research finds that people are, indeed, imperfect decision-makers who rely on heuristic rules when they try to make sense of unfamiliar situations. And heuristics can let them down. They may underestimate the exponential growth of pandemic diseases. They may have unwarranted faith in \u201chygiene theater\u201d: feeling safe, for example, when they see cleaners wiping down surfaces in stores, without realizing that purifying indoor air is more important. They may underestimate the effectiveness of vaccines when they hear about breakthrough cases, without realizing how rare and mild they are. The best way to counter  pervasive misinformation  is with better information. If officials communicate the evidence guiding their decisions, they demonstrate their respect for the public\u2019s right to know and ability to understand the experts\u2019 findings. The science of risk communication provides methods to convey facts that can be counterintuitive. It shows how practitioners can explain their evidence and reasoning so that the public is ready for changes in the science or on-the-ground realities. Testing messages is key to this process. Experts, like everyone else, exaggerate how well they communicate. The task is particularly challenging when experts communicate with diverse audiences. As a result, experts\u2019 intuitions are not to be trusted. The simplest testing takes just a little time and humility. Ask a few people from each segment of the target audience to think aloud as they read a draft message. Listen for passages they find confusing and for passages they find clear but misinterpret. When they are done reading, ask them what was missing, what went without saying, and how much they trusted the source.\u00a0 Public health emergencies are rarely so rushed that such simple testing is impossible. Competent public health officials have generic messages prepared for the kinds of emergencies they can expect to face. They have people ready to test messages tailored to specific emergencies at short notice. Public health officials routinely rely on community partners to help them understand and address community concerns. Those partners can help test and deliver messages under all but the most dire circumstances. Had federal officials communicated better, they might have changed the course of the pandemic. To craft a way forward, it is helpful to look back at how poor communication confused and alienated much of the public. Some health officials realized early on that the pandemic could be a once-in-a-century event. On January 24, 2020, I attended a meeting of the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, which advises the National Institutes of Health on biological research with military applications. Experts there acknowledged that COVID-19 could be a grave threat, especially if the virus proved to be contagious among asymptomatic individuals, as was shortly established. They knew that the virus could get everywhere and infect everyone. Word quickly spread among medical researchers and epidemiologists, who started work on vaccines and treatments.\u00a0 Government officials did not, however, relay a coherent description of the mounting calamity to everyone else. Many people might have changed travel plans, moved relatives from congregate living facilities, or stocked up on medical supplies had they been told the gravity of the threat. One can only wonder how different people\u2019s lives could have been if officials had shared what they knew. Early on, the federal government blew a major opportunity to curb the spread of the virus when it provided conflicting claims about the efficacy of facemasks. First, officials said that masks were useless, then that they were de rigueur. Officials used the term \u201cfacemask\u201d sloppily. They should have created a standard set of intuitively meaningful terms. Simply distinguishing between \u201chospital grade\u201d and \u201chomemade\u201d could have helped. Officials should then have explained how different masks worked, with something as simple as describing the fibers in a homemade mask having \u201csmall enough holes to catch cough droplets, but not the much finer aerosol particles that people exhale.\u201d A troubling possibility is that federal officials shaded the truth about the efficacy of facemasks to ensure there would be sufficient masks for frontline workers. If that dissembling is true or is perceived to be true, public trust in government could, and perhaps should, suffer. A moral appeal might have convinced most people to follow a message like \u201cuse homemade masks so that frontline workers can use the hospital grade ones.\u201d A competent communications program could have crafted and evaluated that message. In the spring of 2020, many people accepted the model-based claim that a lockdown would \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and keep hospitals from being overwhelmed. However, little effort was made to explain the logic of that calculation and its limitations. In some states, officials shut down whatever they could, invoking the vague catchall phrase \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d except for the ambiguously defined \u201cessential services\u201d sector. In both  perception and reality , these policies left open places that should have been closed and closed places that could have been left open. Officials claimed that they were \u201cfollowing the science.\u201d Without showing the science, however, they left some people feeling that their lives were disrupted for no good reason and other people feeling that they were left  needlessly exposed to risk . Reopening decisions were often no better explained. Had officials tested messages explaining their decisions, they could have satisfied the public\u2019s right to know. They might also have discovered that some of their explanations did not hold water, potentially prodding them to change their policies for reopening and to protect public health at the least public cost. The movie industry showed that it didn\u2019t have to be this way. The governors of California and New York asked the industry to produce a reopening plan for state approval. Four union groups reached consensus on work practices, informed by health experts. For example, actors used personal makeup kits and crews got boxed lunches rather than buffets. The parties reached an agreement on testing protocols, informed by quantitative risk analyses. After negotiations with the studios and the states, sets reopened and have been largely disease free. Throughout the process, draft documents were shared, critiqued, and revised among the parties\u2014communications that afforded them a shared understanding of the policies that reflected their feedback. In the summer of 2020, a National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine committee recommended a plan for the equitable allocation of COVID-19 vaccines once they became available. It charged the DHHS with gathering information, developing messages, and partnering with trusted community groups, such as community colleges, tribal health clinics, and school nurse associations. The plan was for DHHS to create messages that their partners would tailor to their communities\u2014and provide the federal government with feedback on how those messages were being received. The report emphasized the need for a firewall between risk communication (just the facts) and health promotion (here\u2019s what we want you to do). It recommended that the federal government provide the unvarnished truth, with continually updated estimates of the safety and effectiveness of the different vaccines in different populations. But it failed to do so. Had federal officials been more transparent, they could have prepared the public for the vaccine campaign\u2019s inevitable surprises. This would have made it easier to explain why the government was approving boosters for just some groups and why it paused administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after it discovered that a very small number of patients suffered from blood clots after receiving it. To date there is no systematic risk communication program. Instead of tested messaging, relying on risk communication science, officials are running an amateur hour. They say whatever seems right to them without sharing their evidence or explaining their reasoning. And they do so in terms unfamiliar to much of their audience. Rather than demonstrating their diligence and competence, officials have  sown needless worry and distrust . In early September, the White House announced it would \u201csupport evidence-based public health communication [with] community engagement strategies, based in social science research . . . to establish trusted communications channels for conveying critical public health information.\u201d That could be a step in the right direction. Whether the federal government is able to make good on that declaration will depend on a troika of factors. Public health officials will need to share their evidence. They will need to use the science of risk communication to make that evidence as clear as possible. And they will need to test their messages to ensure that they are understood. If federal officials do not make sound risk communication central to their pandemic strategy, they will continue to dig themselves and the American public into a hole.

Impelled by an overwhelming desire to hunt down those responsible for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States launched military invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, where it toppled regimes that had little or nothing to do with 9/11. Initially successful at that task and eventually accompanied by rhetoric about spreading democracy and stability in the Middle East, the wars soon devolved into extended counterinsurgency (or counteroccupation) operations that have resulted in the deaths of more than 100 times as many people as perished on 9/11. But it hasn\u2019t always been this way. The militarization of the post-9/11 period has been a glaring, extended, and highly consequential aberration. During the quarter century before that, the United States pursued a foreign policy that was far more humble militarily, and it seems ready to resume that tradition after its exhausting and costly 9/11-induced military ventures, which have so thoroughly failed to deliver satisfactory results at an acceptable cost. And the country may now have a president fully committed to carrying out such a policy. In the wake of its withdrawal from the Vietnam War in 1973, the United States fell into something that has been dubbed the \u201cVietnam syndrome.\u201d Although it still pursued the Cold War with the Soviet Union, it substantially avoided the active use of U.S. military force to do so. In the late 1970s, in fact, the United States essentially let its policy of containing the Soviet Union lapse and watched as the Soviets welcomed 10 new countries into their camp: Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Grenada, Laos, Mozambique, Nicaragua, South Yemen, and Vietnam. All of those countries soon became dependent on Moscow economically, politically, and sometimes militarily\u2014particularly Afghanistan, where the Soviets found it necessary to intervene with force in order to keep their allies in power. As it turned out, the Soviets eventually came to realize that they might have been better off being contained. American military force was applied rather sparingly during the entire last quarter of the twentieth century. The most assertive Cold War actions by the United States during that period were the military invasion of the small Caribbean island of Grenada in 1983 and the operation to support anti-Soviet rebels in Afghanistan. The United States also bombed Libya for a day in 1986 in retaliation for the Libyan government\u2019s sponsorship of terrorist activities; invaded Panama in 1989 to depose an offending regime; and led an international coalition in 1991 to reverse Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait. In all cases, the opponents were scarcely formidable. Although the Iraqi army may have looked impressive on paper, it  lacked  strategy, tactics, defenses, leadership, and morale, and it responded to confrontation with the U.S. military mostly by fleeing or by surrendering. Other military ventures Washington pursued between the Vietnam War and 9/11 were even more limited and were carried out mostly for humanitarian purposes. American troops were sent to Lebanon in 1983 to help police a cease-fire there, but they were abruptly pulled out when 241 of them were killed in their barracks by a terrorist bomb. In 1992, American soldiers helped stabilize Somalia, which was in the midst of a civil war and an attendant famine. But Washington withdrew its forces after 18 soldiers were killed in a chaotic firefight. Stung by this experience, the Clinton administration did not act to stop the genocide in nearby Rwanda in 1994. There were great concerns about civil war in the former Yugoslavia in the early 1990s, but along with much handwringing, the U.S. military role involved little more than supplying aid and advice and, toward the end of the conflict, conducting limited bombing missions against Serbian targets in Bosnia. Only after the fighting was over did Washington send in troops to perform policing operations. A few years later, the United States led a NATO bombing campaign against Serbia to stop violence against Kosovo Albanians, but no American forces ever got close to fighting on the ground. Overall, this does not suggest a country looking for a fight, questing after monsters to destroy, or seeking to act like a hegemon. It is true, however, that American rhetoric during this period did not match its military humility. President Ronald Reagan insisted that world peace was at stake in the civil war in Lebanon, and President George H. W. Bush opined that his war in the Gulf would \u201cchart the future of the world for the next 100 years.\u201d In addition, Bush (and later President Bill Clinton) declared that a coup in Haiti was an extraordinary threat to the security and economy of the United States. There have also been proclamations about how the United States is \u201cthe one indispensable nation,\u201d suggesting that others are, well, dispensable. Despite all the hyperbolic and self-important rhetoric, the fact remains that between the end of the Vietnam War and the turn of the century, the United States averaged only about 20 combat deaths per year including the toll from the attack in Lebanon (or about half that annual average if those deaths are excluded). Over the same period, the total number of military personnel dropped by 720,000, and military spending declined from 5.6 percent of U.S. GDP to 3.1 percent. In the presidential election campaign of 2000, no one seems to have opposed George W. Bush\u2019s explicit support for a \u201chumble\u201d foreign policy. Indeed, his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, deemed the idea to be \u201can important one.\u201d To a considerable degree, both candidates were in tune with the times. Any commitment to humility disappeared when al Qaeda attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. After the attacks, Bush abruptly abandoned humility to proclaim that the country\u2019s \u201cresponsibility to history\u201d was now to \u201crid the world of evil.\u201d With this extravagant goal in mind, the United States launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and began to hunt down terrorist suspects across the globe. The U.S. reaction to the 9/11 attacks accounts for the overwhelming amount of American military action over the last 50 years. Without 9/11, the comparative military humility of the last quarter of the twentieth century would likely have continued. Neither of the two post-9/11 wars was necessary. Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime in Iraq with its ramshackle army was fully containable and deterrable, and it was unlikely that the insecure Taliban regime in Afghanistan, where al Qaeda had carried out training, needed to be overthrown. The relationship between the Taliban and al Qaeda was often very uncomfortable, and the regime might have been  susceptible  to international pressure\u2014especially from Saudi Arabia, which had been trying to extradite terror chief Osama bin Laden for years. The 9/11 attack did not prove to be a harbinger\u2014no terrorist attack before or after, in a war zone or out of one, has inflicted even one-tenth as much total destruction. And al Qaeda central, while inspiring some wannabes abroad and creating many videos, has done almost nothing of consequence in 20 years. Even under siege, it is difficult to see why it could not have infiltrated a few operatives into the United States legally or illegally or carried out local attacks like the shooting rampage in Mumbai in 2008. That was not how it looked at first, of course, and some degree of alarm was justified for a while. That alarm, however, should in time have been reassessed; with little exception, it was not. The same holds for the establishment of a massive apparatus to deal with terrorism within the United States that has cost well over $2 trillion. For this to be justified, it would have had to deter, disrupt, or protect against about three 9/11 attacks every four\u00a0years. In conducting the Iraq war, U.S. leaders seemed to have believed that other actors would not react. But Iran had a huge incentive to make the American occupation of neighboring Iraq as miserable as possible, and terrorists from around the world were attracted to the fray, something warned about before the U.S. invasions. In Afghanistan, the notion was that American soldiers \u201ccould walk into the world\u2019s most conservative villages, make friends, hunt their enemies, and build a better society,\u201d as Graeme Smith wrote in his book,  The Dogs Are Eating Them Now: Our War in Afghanistan . Instead, attacks by the foreigners regularly rallied tribal members to the Taliban\u2019s cause. As it became clear just how costly and counterproductive the main conflicts of the \u201cwar on terror\u201d had become, Washington began to shift back to a  humbler military approach . In a major statement in January 2012, the Defense Department stressed that \u201cU.S. forces will no longer be sized to conduct largescale, prolonged stability operations.\u201d This suggests that the military and its leaders had concluded that they simply didn\u2019t know how to  successfully execute such missions , and, in that sense, it expressed a degree of humility. Presumably with this in mind, at least in part, policymakers worked to reconfigure the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq to reduce the death rate of U.S. military forces. In Afghanistan, the rate was over 400 per year in 2010\u201311, but it declined to under 25 per year later. The death rate in Iraq was over 800 per year between 2004 and 2007, but it declined to under 70 per year in 2010\u201311 and to less than 25 per year thereafter. (All of these rates, however, are much lower than those suffered earlier in the wars in Korea and Vietnam.) In 2014, Washington sent troops back to Iraq to fight the Islamic State, or ISIS, but in the years that followed, the United States mostly provided air support while local fighters bore the brunt of combat deaths; about 20 U.S. service members were killed in the conflict. Both the Obama and  Trump administrations  moved to reduce U.S. commitments to the \u201cforever wars,\u201d echoing a shift in American public opinion. Indicative of the public\u2019s wariness about military ventures abroad was its response to bipartisan support in Congress in 2013 for the punitive bombing of Syria after the ruling regime of Bashar al-Assad was deemed to have carried out a poison gas attack on civilians. Out of concern that the action would lead to further involvement in the conflict, the public was strongly opposed to using force\u2014as members of Congress of both parties found when they went home to their districts. Evidence of this emerging American aversion to the 9/11 wars could be found as early as 2005, as one of us (Mueller)\u00a0 noted \u00a0then.\u00a0Now, the United States seems to have fully embraced an \u201cIraq syndrome\u201d or an \u201cIraq/Afghanistan syndrome,\u201d and it has moved back to a considerable degree of humility. As something of an indicator,  military spending  as a percentage of GDP, which rose considerably in the decade after 9/11, is back to the levels of 2000. The American public might still support a mostly airborne campaign against international terrorism, but there is little appetite for invasion and occupation. Something like humility can perhaps be seen today even in the reaction to the rise of China, which many see as the primary danger out there. Even alarmists push for little more than rearranging the U.S. military (or selling submarines to allies) in a (potentially quixotic) effort to somehow \u201cbalance\u201d against China\u2019s (primarily economic) rise. Other proposals have even less bite. For example, they advocate working with allies, improving American officials\u2019 understanding of China, calling out China\u2019s repressive policies, countering Beijing\u2019s efforts to potentially control communication networks, and cooperating on common interests, such as climate change. But you do not hear calls for major military operations to counter China. After the extended aberration caused by the overreaction to 9/11, American military humility appears to be back. And as the country limps from its 9/11-induced failure in Afghanistan, it even seems possible that official rhetoric  will mellow , as suggested by Biden\u2019s recent UN speech. Self-infatuated proclamations about American superpowerdom, exceptionalism, and indispensable nationhood, seen by many to be arrogant, may subside, at least for now.

In 2014, Washington sent troops back to Iraq to fight the Islamic State, or ISIS, but in the years that followed, the United States mostly provided air support while local fighters bore the brunt of combat deaths; about 20 U.S. service members were killed in the conflict.@@Both the Obama and @@ moved to reduce U.S. commitments to the \u201cforever wars,\u201d echoing a shift in American public opinion. Indicative of the public\u2019s wariness about military ventures abroad was its response to bipartisan support in Congress in 2013 for the punitive bombing of Syria after the ruling regime of Bashar al-Assad was deemed to have carried out a poison gas attack on civilians. Out of concern that the action would lead to further involvement in the conflict, the public was strongly opposed to using force\u2014as members of Congress of both parties found when they went home to their districts.@@Evidence of this emerging American aversion to the 9/11 wars could be found as early as 2005, as one of us (Mueller)\u00a0@@\u00a0then.\u00a0Now, the United States seems to have fully embraced an \u201cIraq syndrome\u201d or an \u201cIraq/Afghanistan syndrome,\u201d and it has moved back to a considerable degree of humility. As something of an indicator, @@ as a percentage of GDP, which rose considerably in the decade after 9/11, is back to the levels of 2000. The American public might still support a mostly airborne campaign against international terrorism, but there is little appetite for invasion and occupation.@@Something like humility can perhaps be seen today even in the reaction to the rise of China, which many see as the primary danger out there. Even alarmists push for little more than rearranging the U.S. military (or selling submarines to allies) in a (potentially quixotic) effort to somehow \u201cbalance\u201d against China\u2019s (primarily economic) rise. Other proposals have even less bite. For example, they advocate working with allies, improving American officials\u2019 understanding of China, calling out China\u2019s repressive policies, countering Beijing\u2019s efforts to potentially control communication networks, and cooperating on common interests, such as climate change. But you do not hear calls for major military operations to counter China.@@After the extended aberration caused by the overreaction to 9/11, American military humility appears to be back. And as the country limps from its 9/11-induced failure in Afghanistan, it even seems possible that official rhetoric @@, as suggested by Biden\u2019s recent UN speech.

era of cyberconflict in which catastrophic computer-based attacks would wreak havoc on the physical world. News media warned of doomsday scenarios; officials in Washington publicly fretted about a \u201ccyber\u2013Pearl Harbor\u201d that would take lives and destroy critical infrastructure. The most dire predictions, however, did not come to pass. The United States has not been struck by devastating cyberattacks with physical effects; it seems that even if U.S. adversaries wanted to carry out such assaults, traditional forms of deterrence would prevent them from acting. Behind those mistaken warnings lay an assumption that the only alternative to cyberpeace must be cyberwar. But in the years since, it has become clear that like all realms of conflict, the domain of cyberspace is shaped not by a binary between war and peace but by a spectrum between those two poles\u2014and most cyberattacks fall somewhere in that murky space. The obvious upside of this outcome is that the worst fears of death and destruction have not been realized. There is a downside, however: the complex nature of cyberconflict has made it more difficult for the United States to craft an effective cyberstrategy. And even if lives have not been lost and infrastructure has mostly been spared, it is hardly the case that cyberattacks have been harmless. U.S. adversaries have honed their cyber-skills to inflict damage on U.S. national security, the American economy, and, most worrisome of all, American democracy. Meanwhile, Washington has struggled to move past its initial perception of the problem, clinging to outmoded ideas that have limited its responses. The United States has also demonstrated an unwillingness to consistently confront its adversaries in the cyber-realm and has suffered from serious self-inflicted wounds that have left it in a poor position to advance its national interests in cyberspace. To do better, the United States must focus on the most pernicious threats of all: cyberattacks aimed at weakening societal trust, the underpinnings of democracy, and the functioning of a globalized economy. The Biden administration seems to recognize the need for a new approach. But to make significant progress, it will need to reform the country\u2019s cyberstrategy, starting with its most fundamental aspect: the way Washington understands the problem. SHOTS FIRED The first known cyberattack occurred in 1988, when Robert Morris, a graduate student in computer science, released a small piece of software\u2014eventually dubbed \u201cthe Morris worm\u201d\u2014that created outages across the still nascent Internet. During the two decades that followed, cybersecurity remained the concern mostly of geeky hackers and shadowy intelligence operatives. That all changed in 2010 with the Stuxnet operation, a devastatingly effective cyberattack on centrifuges that Iran used to enrich uranium. U.S. leaders soon began sounding the alarm about their own country\u2019s vulnerability. As early as 2009, President Barack Obama had warned of cyberattacks that could plunge \u201centire cities into darkness.\u201d Three years later, while briefing the Senate Armed Services Committee, Keith Alexander, the director of the National Security Agency ( NSA ), said it was only a matter of time before cyberattacks destroyed critical infrastructure. Around the same time, Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, claimed that \u201cthe prospect of mass casualties\u201d made cyberattacks \u201cas dangerous as terrorism.\u201d These warnings seemed prescient when, in 2012, Iranian operatives targeted the oil company Saudi Aramco with malware, wiping out data on 30,000 computers. Two weeks later, Iran targeted the Qatari company RasGas, one of the largest natural gas producers in the world, in a similar strike. These cyberattacks were by far the most destructive in history and marked the first time a government had employed an offensive operation in cyberspace against a U.S. partner. The strikes rattled world energy markets. To signal support for the Saudis, Washington deployed a team of Pentagon cybersecurity experts to Riyadh. Two months after the Iranian attacks, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta gave a high-profile speech in which he warned of other countries or terrorists using cyberweapons to derail passenger trains or freight trains loaded with lethal chemicals, contaminate water supplies in major cities, shut down the power grid, or disable communication networks and military hardware. Americans, Panetta declared, needed to prepare for a kind of \u201ccyber\u2013Pearl Harbor: an attack that would cause physical destruction and the loss of life [and would] paralyze and shock the nation and create a new, profound sense of vulnerability.\u201d Panetta also attempted to outline the U.S. strategy for deterrence in cyberspace, arguing that \u201cimproved defenses alone\u201d would prove insufficient. When the U.S. national security services detected an imminent cyberattack of significant consequences, he said, they would need \u201cthe option to take action.\u201d And so, he explained, the military had developed \u201cthe capability to conduct effective [offensive cyber-]operations to counter threats to [U.S.] national interests in cyberspace.\u201d   Americans, Panetta declared, needed to prepare for a kind of \u201ccyber\u2013Pearl Harbor.\u201d From 2012 to 2014, the National Security Council staff held dozens of senior-level meetings to draft a complicated set of policies\u2014known as Presidential Policy Directive 20\u2014that established guidelines for when the United States could launch offensive cyber-operations to deter future attacks. At the Pentagon, the Joint Staff devoted several straight months to developing strict protocols for when the secretary of defense could approve an \u201cemergency cyber action\u201d\u2014a targeted cyberattack to neutralize and counter an adversarial attack on the homeland.  That planning was put to the test in 2014, when North Korean operatives conducted the first-ever destructive cyberattack on U.S. soil, exfiltrating heaps of confidential information from servers belonging to Sony Pictures, which was planning to release a film that mocked the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. The hackers spread the information, including embarrassing emails, throughout the Internet; knocked out Sony\u2019s digital networks; and threatened to carry out further \u201cterrorist attacks\u201d in cyberspace. For weeks, the U.S. intelligence community feared that North Korean operatives had prepositioned cybermunitions inside American critical infrastructure and would soon detonate them. That did not happen, and in many ways, the Obama administration\u2019s response to the attack was sophisticated and effective. The president directly called out the North Koreans for the hack, and the administration immediately levied economic sanctions, the first ever imposed in response to a cyberattack. The combination of public attribution and sanctions seemed to deter Pyongyang from conducting additional attacks. But the most important takeaway was that even after two years of planning and development, the U.S. military did not have the cyber-response capabilities Panetta had promised. LESSONS NOT LEARNED Part of the problem was that the Obama administration took an old-school approach to cyberspace that was stuck, in some ways, in an archaic, Cold War\u2013style paradigm according to which cyber-operations could quickly escalate into a full-blown war. This perspective carried over into the Pentagon\u2019s decisions when it came to building a force structure for the cyber-domain: in 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates established U.S. Cyber Command, which is subordinate to the four-star commander of U.S. Strategic Command, the notoriously slow-moving organization that oversees the country\u2019s nuclear weapons. This structure suggested that the administration saw conflict in the cyber-domain as analogous to nuclear conflict or military activities in outer space, rather than as a dynamic sphere of operations more akin to counterterrorism or the world of special forces. Gates also determined that the new command would not carry out so-called information operations designed to influence the perceptions, thoughts, or beliefs of foreign actors in ways that would serve U.S. strategy. These decisions delighted Washington\u2019s Russian adversaries. During a 2013 meeting between senior U.S. defense officials and their Russian counterparts, a high-ranking officer in the Russian military, General Nikolai Makarov, taunted the Americans. \u201cOne uses information to destroy nations, not networks,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re happy that you Americans are so stupid as to build an entire Cyber Command that doesn\u2019t have a mission of information warfare!\u201d At the time, defense leaders didn\u2019t consider that the United States might be one of the nations that Makarov had in mind. After  Russian interference  in the U.S. presidential election three years later, his remarks took on an even more sinister cast. Cyber Command\u2019s structure and mission had serious consequences in the years that followed, especially in the U.S. campaign against the Islamic State (also known as  ISIS ). The Pentagon had structured the new organization and designed its capabilities based on existing war plans that focused on rival countries; as a result, Cyber Command had very few resources dedicated to counterterrorism. During the first two years of the conflict, poor leadership at the top, a lack of operational capability, and an unwillingness to risk intelligence sources and methods resulted in Cyber Command\u2019s failure to disrupt ISIS operations. In 2015, this debacle led a top military commander of the U.S. effort against  ISIS  to declare, \u201cI only wish that Cyber Command could inflict as much pain on  ISIS  as DISA does on me!\u201d (DISA, the Defense Information Systems Agency, provides tech support to the U.S. military.) A hacker in Kyiv, November 2016   Gleb Garanich / Reuters   Beneath these flawed decisions on organization and mission lay a deeper failure to learn the lessons of the 2014 North Korean hack of Sony: cyberattacks require an immediate response, public attribution, and diplomatic confrontation. In the wake of that attack, China and Russia each carried out an increasingly bold and insidious wave of cyberattacks. In the spring of 2014, for example, a group of operatives linked to the Kremlin attempted to derail the Ukrainian presidential election with a potent combination of hacking, disinformation, and denial-of-service attacks. Ukrainian cybersecurity experts narrowly prevented the assault from succeeding. But the White House was unwilling to confront Russia or provide Ukraine with any type of support in the cyber-domain. Then, in December 2015, Russian-backed operatives attacked Ukraine\u2019s electric grid, leaving parts of the country without power for days in the midst of winter weather. Once again, the Obama administration stood by without responding. This likely contributed to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s calculus that he could conduct cyber- and information operations to interfere with the U.S. presidential election in 2016 without fear of reprisal. He was right: the Obama administration did little to push back against Russian meddling during the summer and fall of 2016\u2014until it became a crisis and hit the front page of  The New York Times . The Obama White House proved similarly unwilling to confront China over its transgressions in cyberspace. This was of a piece with the administration\u2019s emphasis on building stable economic relations with Beijing, which also overrode concerns about Chinese human rights abuses and China\u2019s aggressive military moves in the South China Sea. Even before North Korea\u2019s Sony attack, China had taken advantage of this passivity to steal American intellectual property on a massive scale between 2008 and 2013, to the tune of between $200 billion and $600 billion of value per year. The strategic impact of this theft is difficult to prove empirically, but it almost certainly gave a huge lift to Beijing\u2019s Made in China 2025 initiative, which seeks to advance China\u2019s domestic production of artificial intelligence systems, telecommunications, clean energy technology, aerospace products, and biotechnology.  China took advantage of U.S. passivity, stealing intellectual property on a massive scale. Later, in 2014 and 2015, Chinese intelligence operatives penetrated networks belonging to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management and exfiltrated the personnel files of around two million former or retired federal employees and more than two million current ones, including information on nearly all the background investigations of Americans who held security clearances at the top-secret level. Prodded by intense congressional pressure and media scrutiny, Obama confronted Chinese President Xi Jinping during a September 2015 meeting at the White House. Obama offered to not publicly attribute the OPM hack to China, and in exchange, Xi agreed to stop intelligence operations against U.S. firms and to establish a diplomatic working group to discuss issues related to cyberspace. Immediately following the summit, the volume of Chinese intellectual property theft plummeted, and Beijing and Washington held a round of talks about cybertheft. This positive outcome clearly demonstrated the importance of challenging China\u2014but it also served as a reminder that the administration had waited far too long to take action. U.S. President Donald Trump took office in 2017 with a more assertive, combative tone than that of his predecessor. His administration\u2019s approach to U.S. rivals was inconsistent and unpredictable, but in 2018, the White House approved the elevation of Cyber Command to full combatant command status, which freed the organization from the constraints of working through U.S. Strategic Command. Later that year, National Security Adviser John Bolton announced that the administration would take a more aggressive approach to offensive cyber-operations by permitting the military, with the approval of the secretary of defense, to conduct operations below the legal threshold of an \u201carmed attack.\u201d This policy, known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, set the foundation for cyber-operations, such as denial-of-service attacks and information operations, targeting the Internet Research Agency, a Russian \u201ctroll farm,\u201d and may have prevented the group from interfering in the 2018 congressional midterm elections. These moves demonstrated the effectiveness of low-level, proactive cyber-tactics and drove home the idea that when it comes to cyberspace, deterrence need not take place on the level of grand strategy: low-tech, low-risk, targeted operations can do the trick. The Trump administration\u2019s approach to Russia\u2019s cyber-campaigns was by no means an unqualified success, however, owing to the behavior of the president himself. Trump\u2019s bizarre genuflection toward Putin undermined any coherent strategy against Russia, and Trump\u2019s unwillingness to stand up for U.S. interests vis-\u00e0-vis Russia posed a genuine threat to American  democracy . From his public invitation to the Russians to hack his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, to his endorsement of Putin\u2019s nonsensical proposal to create a joint U.S.-Russian \u201cimpenetrable cybersecurity unit,\u201d Trump repeatedly undermined the efforts of his own country\u2019s law enforcement agencies, intelligence organizations, and military to protect U.S. national security. OWN GOALS But Trump is hardly the only American who has damaged U.S. cybersecurity in recent years. In 2013, an  NSA  contractor, Edward Snowden, perpetrated one of the most significant leaks in U.S. history when he provided journalists\u2014and, according to some accounts, Chinese and Russian intelligence services\u2014with thousands of highly classified documents revealing the expansive reach of the  NSA\u2019s  global operations, including its eavesdropping on senior government officials of countries allied with the United States. It is difficult to overstate the negative impact these disclosures had on U.S. efforts to secure cyberspace. Washington essentially lost all credibility on the world stage when it came to issues regarding cyberspace. After learning that the  NSA  had spied on heads of state, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European governments were in no mood to work with Washington against Chinese or Russian cyber-operations. \u201cTrust needs to be rebuilt,\u201d Merkel said at the time.  In the wake of the revelations, a wide range of governments\u2014from U.S. allies in Europe to China\u2014labeled Washington as the greatest threat to cybersecurity in the world. The fallout from Snowden\u2019s leaks also dealt a devastating blow to the cooperation between the U.S. government and the private sector, an essential aspect of defending U.S. interests in cyberspace. Owing to a fear of bad publicity and the risk of losing business in China, U.S. technology companies that had previously collaborated on unclassified cybersecurity initiatives with the federal government decided to completely halt such cooperation.  Things got worse a few years later when the  NSA  lost control of some of its most sensitive hacking tools. In two separate incidents, employees of an  NSA  unit that was then known as the Office of Tailored Access Operations\u2014an outfit that conducts the agency\u2019s most sensitive cybersurveillance operations\u2014removed extremely powerful tools from top-secret  NSA  networks and, incredibly, took them home. Eventually, the Shadow Brokers\u2014a mysterious hacking group with ties to Russian intelligence services\u2014got their hands on some of the  NSA  tools and released them on the Internet. As one former  TAO  employee told  The Washington Post , these were \u201cthe keys to the kingdom\u201d\u2014digital tools that would \u201cundermine the security of a lot of major government and corporate networks both here and abroad.\u201d One such tool, known as \u201cEternalBlue,\u201d got into the wrong hands and has been used to unleash a scourge of ransomware attacks\u2014in which hackers paralyze computer systems until their demands are met\u2014that will plague the world for years to come. Two of the most destructive cyberattacks in history made use of tools that were based on EternalBlue: the so-called WannaCry attack, launched by North Korea in 2017, which caused major disruptions at the British National Health Service for at least a week, and the NotPetya attack, carried out that same year by Russian-backed operatives, which resulted in more than $10 billion in damage to the global economy and caused weeks of delays at the world\u2019s largest shipping company, Maersk. In the past few years, ransomware attacks have struck hospitals, schools, city governments, and pipelines, driving home the severe nature of the cyberthreat. HOW TO DO BETTER Washington\u2019s decade spent in thrall to an outmoded conception of cyberconflict, the Obama administration\u2019s excessive passivity, the Trump administration\u2019s inconsistency, and the damage caused by leaks and sloppiness meant that when U.S. President Joe Biden took office earlier this year, he inherited  a mess . Getting U.S. policy back on track will require his administration to substantially change the way that Washington conceives of and carries out cybersecurity. That will be particularly challenging given the current security environment, which is being shaped by China\u2019s rollout of the \u201cdigital yuan,\u201d the meteoric rise in the value and impact of cryptocurrencies, the flourishing of disinformation, and the sharp increase in ransomware attacks. Meanwhile, as nuclear negotiations with Iran intensify, the regime in Tehran will likely experiment with new cyber- and information operations to gain leverage at the negotiating table, and China and Russia will almost certainly test the relatively new administration with cyberattacks within the next year. In this climate, the most important thing the Biden administration can do is embrace the notion that countries that can conduct destructive cyberattacks are not likely to be deterred by Washington\u2019s own cyber-capabilities but can still be deterred by the United States\u2019 conventional military power and economic might. When it comes to cyberspace, Washington shouldn\u2019t try to fight fire with fire\u2014or at least not with fire alone. The United States, after all, has many more effective ways to contain and extinguish the flames. With that in mind, the first practical step the administration should take is to prioritize the  defense of data . Working with Congress, Biden must redouble efforts to pass a national data security law that will provide citizens with the right to take legal action against companies that fail to protect their data, similar to the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation. The United States is one of the only major democracies in the world that does not have such a law. As a result, an extraordinarily complex patchwork of state-level privacy and data security laws have sprung up, inhibiting the development of a secure information-based economy. The current effort on Capitol Hill to require companies that provide critical infrastructure\u2014including those in the manufacturing, energy production, and financial services sectors\u2014to notify federal authorities of data breaches represents a promising development. But it is not nearly enough.  When it comes to cyberattacks, Washington shouldn\u2019t fight fire with fire. The administration should also make the rapid public attribution of cyberattacks a core component of its strategy, even in politically complex situations. The conventional wisdom used to hold that it was difficult to attribute cyberattacks with a high level of confidence. But over the past five years, advanced digital forensics have allowed intelligence agencies and private-sector cybersecurity firms to conclude with reasonable certainty who is behind most cyberattacks. That evolution is important: attribution alone has proved to be an effective, if short-lived, way to deter U.S. rivals from carrying out attacks. Better U.S. policy will also require some organizational shifts. For starters, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, established in 2018 within the Department of Homeland Security, must become the true center of gravity for domestic cybersecurity operations; the final authority over such operations should not be granted to intelligence organizations, law enforcement agencies, or the military. In the past three years,  CISA  has developed important capabilities to combat election interference and disinformation campaigns. Now, it must improve its defense of federal government networks, speed the sharing of threat indicators with the private sector, and offer expertise and operational support to the providers of critical infrastructure that face threats from ransomware.  To do all that,  CISA  will need more funding: the organization\u2019s current annual budget of $3 billion should be tripled over the next four years, and it should eventually equal that of the  NSA . Law enforcement still has an important role to play, particularly when it comes to domestic defensive cyber-operations to thwart ransomware attacks.  The  FBI  recently undertook an effective and  creative effort to remove malicious tools implanted by Chinese intelligence services in hundreds of servers across  the United States. In a novel and precedent - setting step, the bureau obtained  warrants to unilaterally identify and delete the Chinese malware without the consent of the equipment\u2019s owners. The legal authority for that operation was established by an update to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; the administration should seek additional innovative updates to laws that will allow the  FBI  to take more proactive measures.  The U.S. military must also continue to adapt to the cyber-era. Biden should shape Cyber Command into something more akin to today\u2019s nimble, flexible Joint Special Operations Command and less like the lumbering Strategic Air Command of the 1950s. Cyber Command has relied too much on the  NSA  to create unique, nonattributable cybertools, which can take years to develop; to increase its agility, Cyber Command should turn to less complex, \u201cburnable\u201d tools, that is, ones that are expendable because they are already publicly available, which means there is no need to conceal their origin. The Trump administration, to its credit, upped Washington\u2019s game by increasing the frequency of low-tech, publicly attributable offensive cyber-operations. This had the effect of bolstering U.S. credibility in the cyber-realm\u2014even in the face of Trump\u2019s erratic personal conduct. For example, after Iran\u2019s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in 2019, Cyber Command conducted a retaliatory attack on a database crucial to the group. The strike demonstrated Washington\u2019s ability to achieve strategic goals while avoiding escalatory tactics.  Geopolitics are now conducive to U.S. leadership on cyberspace. New legislation and new approaches would go a long way toward fixing Washington\u2019s flawed  cyberstrategy . But the government cannot improve U.S. cybersecurity on its own: it must meaningfully engage with the private sector  to build cyberdefenses and cyber- deterrence. Companies are in the cross hairs of hackers of many stripes, and corporate leaders have become de facto national security decision-makers. To create shared norms and encourage the independent enforcement of cyber-protection standards, at least by publicly traded companies, Congress should consider creating a cybersecurity analog to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which protects the integrity of markets, and a version for cyberspace of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which shape the public disclosures that companies must make. Even if Washington does everything right, it will still need global cooperation. Luckily, the geopolitical environment today is conducive to strong U.S. diplomatic leadership on issues regard ing cyberspace. Washington has mostly recovered from the fallout of  the Snowden  and the NSA leaks, and  the world has finally recognized that the Chinese and Russian models of Internet autocracy are antithetical to a  liberal order  and a globalized economy. Washington needs to take advantage of this state of affairs through intensive cooperation with like-minded countries, such as France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.  The  UN  is not the place to do so, however: in that forum, China and Russia can advance their interests by entangling Washington and its partners in abstract debates about norms even as they wantonly violate those norms in the real world. Many strategists have suggested that  NATO  could serve as the center of gravity for cooperation in  cyberspace  between the United States and its allies and partners, but the organization was built for the Cold War and is too clunky to foster creative strategies. Instead, Washington should pursue a series of bilateral agreements to prevent the spread of black-market ransomware tools. One model might be the Proliferation Security Initiative, a multilateral effort inaugurated by the George W. Bush administration to improve the interdiction of weapons of mass destruction.  If American policymakers have learned anything in the past decade, it is that cyberconflict is a murky business, one that resists black-and-white notions about war and peace. That lack of clarity in the battle space makes it all the more important for Washington to be clear about its goals and strategies. The cyber-realm will always be messy. But U.S. cyber-policy does not have to be. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

stood beside Chinese President Xi Jinping in the White House Rose Garden and announced a historic deal to curb cyber-related economic espionage. The scope of the agreement was modest, committing China and the United States only to stop stealing or aiding in the cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property in order to boost domestic industry. It was an easy promise for the United States to make, since Washington had long prohibited U.S. intelligence services from conducting economic espionage for the benefit of private companies. But it was a groundbreaking pledge for China, whose military and intelligence agencies had for more than a decade engaged in massive cyber-enabled theft of U.S. intellectual property and state secrets in order to advantage Chinese companies.\u00a0 The agreement was equally groundbreaking because of how it came about. In the weeks leading up to the Rose Garden ceremony, Obama had threatened to sanction Chinese companies and citizens who continued to target U.S. companies with cyberattacks or exploit stolen intellectual property for commercial gain. These threats, the first that an American president had ever issued in response to Chinese economic espionage, were calibrated to address not just China\u2019s cyber-activities but also its broader economic and strategic objectives. \u201cWe are preparing a number of measures that will indicate to the Chinese that this is not just a matter of us being mildly upset, but is something that will put significant strains on the bilateral relationship if not resolved,\u201d Obama told business leaders the week before Xi\u2019s visit. \u201cWe are prepared to take some countervailing actions in order to get their attention.\u201d\u00a0 Initially, the agreement was a limited success. Intrusions from Chinese government-affiliated groups dropped to their lowest level in over a decade in 2016. And for the next two years, American companies enjoyed a brief respite from what had previously been an unrelenting assault by Chinese military- and intelligence-affiliated hackers. But the d\u00e9tente was short-lived. In 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump launched a trade war that undercut the United States\u2019 economic leverage over China and reduced Beijing\u2019s incentives to adhere to the pact. Later that same year, the National Security Agency accused China of violating the agreement, and the U.S. Justice Department proceeded to indict Chinese hackers on charges of cyber-enabled economic espionage. The Trump administration threatened to impose broad sanctions on Chinese companies, but it ultimately sanctioned only a few firms.\u00a0 Although it failed in the end, the 2015 agreement between Obama and Xi offers a promising model for addressing cyberthreats. Until recently, the United States has tended to approach issues related to cyberspace as a narrow set of technical problems to be solved primarily with a combination of defensive and limited deterrence measures. Those defensive efforts have included funding the modernization of technology, regulating industries involved in critical infrastructure, and improving collaboration and information sharing between the government and industry. Deterrence has typically involved punitive actions by law enforcement or sanctions against individual perpetrators or their affiliated military and intelligence agencies. After North Korean hackers breached Sony Pictures in 2014, for instance, the United States sanctioned individual North Korean officials and indicted three North Korean intelligence operatives.  Russia\u2019s interference  in the 2016 U.S. presidential election occasioned a similar response: Washington imposed sanctions on Russian intelligence agencies, indicted Russian military officers, expelled Russian intelligence officers operating under diplomatic cover, and shut down several Russian facilities located in the United States. The United States has also sought to deter adversaries by threatening to take the offensive and carry out retaliatory cyberattacks. Yet despite all these steps, neither North Korea nor Russia\u2014nor any other U.S. adversary, for that matter\u2014has ceased targeting the United States.\u00a0 That is because vulnerability to cyberattacks is not a technical problem that hardened defenses or narrow, cyber-focused deterrence can fix. Cyberattacks are a symptom, not a disease; the underlying conditions are broader geopolitical problems that demand geopolitical solutions\u2014namely high-level negotiations with adversaries in the pursuit of agreements that all parties can live with.\u00a0 As the range of cyberthreats multiplies and the frequency and severity of attacks increase, Washington needs a dose of cyber-realism. It must treat cyberthreats as a geopolitical and national security priority that demands hard-nosed diplomacy\u2014backed by all of the United States\u2019 tools for gaining leverage\u2014to entice or threaten U.S. adversaries into changing their behavior, as Obama did in 2015. The specific carrots and sticks will need to be tailored to each adversary, taking into account its unique geopolitical ambitions. But the sticks will have to include more aggressive deterrence, aimed not just at the hostile military and intelligence agencies that perpetrate cyberattacks but at the regimes to which those agencies answer. Cyberspace is not an isolated realm of its own, after all, but an extension of the broader geopolitical battlefield.\u00a0 For most of the last three decades, U.S. cybersecurity policy and cyberstrategy have treated cyberattacks as if they emerged from the ether, unconnected to the geopolitical conflicts and competitions that structure the global security order. As a result,  much of U.S. cyberstrategy  has focused on managing the effects of cyberattacks through defense and narrow deterrence of actors in cyberspace rather than addressing the causes of cyberattacks. Defensive measures can be either proactive or reactive, seeking to protect networks from intrusions or to trying to limit the damage when intrusions inevitably occur. But neither of these types of defensive measures has proved equal to the increasing cyberthreat\u2014as Russia\u2019s  recent and extensive hack  of U.S. government networks via network-monitoring software made by the Texas-based company SolarWinds, among other major incidents in cyberspace, has made clear. Attackers have an inherent advantage in cyberspace: when the cost of each attempted hack is low and the penalties are effectively nonexistent, hackers seeking to infiltrate even hardened targets can afford to spend months and sometimes years trying to find a way in. That asymmetric advantage makes aggressors quite likely to succeed eventually, since they need to get lucky only once, whereas defenders must discover and stop each hacking attempt.\u00a0 Even if the U.S. government could sufficiently harden its own defenses, moreover, it would not be able to prevent all or even most cyberattacks, many of which are directed against smaller entities, such as schools, hospitals, police departments, small businesses, and nonprofit organizations, which have neither the resources nor the knowledge to implement complex cybersecurity strategies. These organizations will have little chance of fending off sophisticated cyberattacks from hostile countries no matter how effective U.S. government defenses become. Deterrence, as it has traditionally been practiced, has been similarly ineffective at preventing cyberattacks. In the past four years, the U.S. government has sanctioned and indicted government officials and contractors from all its four primary adversaries: China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Yet these states regard the cost of such measures as relatively minor, and they continue to carry out or condone cyberattacks at an unrelenting pace. More aggressive sanctions that would threaten the underpinnings of economic growth in these countries, such as sanctions against industrial national champions, would likely achieve a greater effect. But because the United States does not approach these attacks in their broader geopolitical contexts, it has failed to mount appropriately tailored responses. On occasion, the United States has  gone on the cyberoffensive . Ahead of the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, for instance, U.S. intelligence agencies sought to disrupt the Internet Research Agency, Russia\u2019s infamous Internet troll factory. Such offensive measures have occasionally succeeded on a tactical level, impeding or slowing adversaries\u2019 attacks for a time. But they have done nothing to change the basic calculus of U.S. adversaries in cyberspace or to make the United States less vulnerable to cyberattacks in the long term.\u00a0 The vast majority of cyberattacks against U.S. entities, whether by criminal groups or governments, emanate from the four countries\u2014China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia\u2014that also pose the greatest conventional military threats to the United States. To effectively counter the cyberthreat from these countries, Washington must consider their broader geopolitical goals. China is the United States\u2019 most formidable adversary in cyberspace, as well as in the conventional military domain. It has made no secret of its ambition to surpass the United States as the world\u2019s leading economic and military superpower, and its activities in cyberspace follow logically from this goal. The vast majority of Chinese cyberattacks are instances of traditional and economic espionage. Between 2010 and 2015, for instance, state-sponsored Chinese hackers systematically targeted U.S. and European aerospace companies, stealing valuable information that China then funneled to its state-owned aerospace manufacturers. This hacking campaign was an enormous success; by the time it was discovered, in 2018, Chinese manufacturers had already built commercial jets based in part on the stolen intellectual property.\u00a0 China\u2019s cyber-espionage  has been especially aggressive in sectors that Beijing deems critical to its economic and national security objectives. Last July, for instance, the National Security Agency, the FBI, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released a joint report warning that Beijing-linked hackers were continuing to target U.S. companies and institutions in strategically important areas, including defense and semiconductor firms, medical institutions, and universities. Compared with other U.S. adversaries, however, China has engaged in relatively little cybercrime and has carried out few destructive cyberattacks. This, too, fits with China\u2019s broader strategic agenda, since such activities could undercut China\u2019s standing on the international stage.\u00a0 Obama and Xi announcing a cyber-d\u00e9tente at the White House, Washington, D.C., September 2015   Doug Mills / Redux   Russia has its own set of geopolitical goals that its cyber-activities aim to advance. Like Beijing, Moscow is motivated by a pugilistic sense of national pride. But unlike China, Russia does not have the economic capacity to compete with the United States. It is increasingly isolated internationally and struggles to maintain its influence in its so-called near abroad. Nevertheless, it is striving to retain its status as a great power, a goal that its leaders believe they can achieve by strengthening their position at home while undercutting the reputation of the United States and its allies and frustrating their international ambitions.\u00a0 Like its Soviet predecessor, the Russian government carries out traditional spying and economic espionage. Today\u2019s Kremlin uses both cybertools and conventional means for this purpose. But Russia\u2019s cyber-activities also focus on sowing political and economic turmoil in the West, undercutting Westerners\u2019 faith in democratic government, and weakening the influence of Western countries in Russia\u2019s neighborhood. Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, its 2017 malware attack that took down networks in Ukraine before spreading around the world, and its 2018 hack of the International Olympic Committee all served this broader agenda.\u00a0 The same is true of Russian ransomware attacks, which, despite being carried out by criminal gangs, represent an important part of the Kremlin\u2019s strategy. The cybercriminals that have targeted thousands of U.S. organizations and extracted over $1 billion in ransoms in recent years have sometimes been protected by Russian security forces, and regardless, the Kremlin\u2019s refusal to crack down on them amounts to a tacit endorsement of their activities. Although cybercrime does not advance Russia\u2019s core national interests, it does serve a strategic purpose: disrupting the U.S. economy and sowing fear among American business leaders. Cybercriminals are also valuable bargaining chips in international negotiations: Russia can offer action against ransomware gangs in exchange for important concessions, without having to address its more strategically important, state-sponsored cyber-activity.\u00a0 The United States\u2019 other two major adversaries, Iran and North Korea, have also used cybertools to advance their domestic and international goals, although less ably than China and Russia. Both countries have done so primarily to circumvent Western sanctions that are squeezing their domestic economies. The North Korean regime has financed itself with tens of millions of dollars accumulated through cybercrime, and Iran has used cyber-enabled economic espionage to get around Western sanctions on defense technologies, petrochemical production, and other strategic sectors. Both countries have also used cyberattacks to weaken their regional rivals, with North Korea launching attacks against South Korea and Iran targeting Israel and Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 Better defensive measures might help insulate U.S. government agencies, private U.S. companies, and individual Americans from the consequences of major cyberattacks carried out by these U.S. adversaries. But neither defense nor deterrence as it is currently practiced can mitigate these threats on its own. Washington\u2019s capabilities might improve, but so, too, will those of its rivals.\u00a0 To halt China\u2019s malign cyber-activity, the United States and its allies will have to convince Beijing to make a deal. In exchange for a de-escalation of the trade war, Beijing might agree to remove market-distorting industrial subsidies, halt the forced transfer of technology, and curb intellectual property theft. Likewise, if the United States wants to check Russia\u2019s nefarious cyber-activities, it will need to ease Moscow\u2019s concerns about U.S. interference in Russian domestic and regional affairs. Addressing the cyberthreat from Iran and North Korea will similarly require making progress on negotiations over their respective nuclear programs, which are by far the most pressing concern for both countries. This might seem like cause for gloomy fatalism about the chances of resolving issues related to cyberspace. In fact, the opposite is true. Like all complex geopolitical challenges,  cyberthreats  can be addressed using the right combination of incentives, disincentives, and compromises. The question for the United States and its allies is whether they are willing to prioritize progress on issues in cyberspace over progress on other geopolitical objectives\u2014and what they are willing to give up for the sake of that progress. Considering the recent slew of major ransomware attacks and supply chain hacks, the Biden administration must urgently answer that question. Then it must back up its rhetoric on cyberspace with hard-nosed diplomacy that can change its adversaries\u2019 behavior.\u00a0 Part of what it will take to force these countries to make a deal will be broader deterrence, including measures that raise the costs to hostile regimes of carrying out cyberattacks while denying them the benefits of doing so. In addition to military and spy agencies, the United States should sanction and prosecute companies and executives in countries, such as China, that benefit from cyber-enabled economic espionage, sending the message that the theft of intellectual property and trade secrets comes at a hefty price. Since anonymous cryptocurrency transfers now fuel so much global cybercrime, the United States should also work with its allies to sanction and shut down cryptocurrency exchanges that cater to criminal operations or that do not perform due diligence on the transactions they facilitate.\u00a0 To be sure, as long as grand bargains remain elusive, the United States will have to harden its  defenses  and make itself more resilient. The U.S. government has a poor record on cybersecurity, so it needs to step up its game and lead by example\u2014for instance, by centralizing all civilian cybersecurity operations within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. It must also incentivize public and private investment in defensive measures, including by subsidizing the costs of defense for municipalities, nonprofits, and small businesses and by holding companies that do not take responsible security measures accountable for negligent failures. Although these measures can only ever be a partial fix, they can limit the damage done by hackers and other cybercriminals until Washington can forge a more lasting diplomatic solution.\u00a0 When the United States faces a military threat from a hostile nation, it does not tell its citizens and businesses to fund their own private armies or to negotiate their own peace deals. Many cyberthreats are not meaningfully different from military or economic threats, and yet the United States allows much of the burden of defending against them to fall on individual companies and citizens. In the short term, the United States must do more to harden its defenses and to help companies and citizens do the same. Ultimately, however, Washington must accept that cyberattacks are primarily an effect, and not a cause, of geopolitical tensions. Unless the United States treats the underlying disease, it will never fully recover from the symptoms. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

The cybercriminals that have targeted thousands of U.S. organizations and extracted over $1 billion in ransoms in recent years have sometimes been protected by Russian security forces, and regardless, the Kremlin\u2019s refusal to crack down on them amounts to a tacit endorsement of their activities. Although cybercrime does not advance Russia\u2019s core national interests, it does serve a strategic purpose: disrupting the U.S. economy and sowing fear among American business leaders. Cybercriminals are also valuable bargaining chips in international negotiations: Russia can offer action against ransomware gangs in exchange for important concessions, without having to address its more strategically important, state-sponsored cyber-activity.\u00a0@@The United States\u2019 other two major adversaries, Iran and North Korea, have also used cybertools to advance their domestic and international goals, although less ably than China and Russia. Both countries have done so primarily to circumvent Western sanctions that are squeezing their domestic economies. The North Korean regime has financed itself with tens of millions of dollars accumulated through cybercrime, and Iran has used cyber-enabled economic espionage to get around Western sanctions on defense technologies, petrochemical production, and other strategic sectors. Both countries have also used cyberattacks to weaken their regional rivals, with North Korea launching attacks against South Korea and Iran targeting Israel and Saudi Arabia.\u00a0@@Better defensive measures might help insulate U.S. government agencies, private U.S. companies, and individual Americans from the consequences of major cyberattacks carried out by these U.S. adversaries. But neither defense nor deterrence as it is currently practiced can mitigate these threats on its own. Washington\u2019s capabilities might improve, but so, too, will those of its rivals.\u00a0@@To halt China\u2019s malign cyber-activity, the United States and its allies will have to convince Beijing to make a deal. In exchange for a de-escalation of the trade war, Beijing might agree to remove market-distorting industrial subsidies, halt the forced transfer of technology, and curb intellectual property theft. Likewise, if the United States wants to check Russia\u2019s nefarious cyber-activities, it will need to ease Moscow\u2019s concerns about U.S. interference in Russian domestic and regional affairs. Addressing the cyberthreat from Iran and North Korea will similarly require making progress on negotiations over their respective nuclear programs, which are by far the most pressing concern for both countries.@@This might seem like cause for gloomy fatalism about the chances of resolving issues related to cyberspace. In fact, the opposite is true. Like all complex geopolitical challenges, @@ can be addressed using the right combination of incentives, disincentives, and compromises. The question for the United States and its allies is whether they are willing to prioritize progress on issues in cyberspace over progress on other geopolitical objectives\u2014and what they are willing to give up for the sake of that progress. Considering the recent slew of major ransomware attacks and supply chain hacks, the Biden administration must urgently answer that question. Then it must back up its rhetoric on cyberspace with hard-nosed diplomacy that can change its adversaries\u2019 behavior.\u00a0@@Part of what it will take to force these countries to make a deal will be broader deterrence, including measures that raise the costs to hostile regimes of carrying out cyberattacks while denying them the benefits of doing so. In addition to military and spy agencies, the United States should sanction and prosecute companies and executives in countries, such as China, that benefit from cyber-enabled economic espionage, sending the message that the theft of intellectual property and trade secrets comes at a hefty price. Since anonymous cryptocurrency transfers now fuel so much global cybercrime, the United States should also work with its allies to sanction and shut down cryptocurrency exchanges that cater to criminal operations or that do not perform due diligence on the transactions they facilitate.\u00a0@@To be sure, as long as grand bargains remain elusive, the United States will have to harden its @@ and make itself more resilient. The U.S. government has a poor record on cybersecurity, so it needs to step up its game and lead by example\u2014for instance, by centralizing all civilian cybersecurity operations within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. It must also incentivize public and private investment in defensive measures, including by subsidizing the costs of defense for municipalities, nonprofits, and small businesses and by holding companies that do not take responsible security measures accountable for negligent failures. Although these measures can only ever be a partial fix, they can limit the damage done by hackers and other cybercriminals until Washington can forge a more lasting diplomatic solution.\u00a0@@When the United States faces a military threat from a hostile nation, it does not tell its citizens and businesses to fund their own private armies or to negotiate their own peace deals. Many cyberthreats are not meaningfully different from military or economic threats, and yet the United States allows much of the burden of defending against them to fall on individual companies and citizens. In the short term, the United States must do more to harden its defenses and to help companies and citizens do the same. Ultimately, however, Washington must accept that cyberattacks are primarily an effect, and not a cause, of geopolitical tensions. Unless the United States treats the underlying disease, it will never fully recover from the symptoms.", "download_timeout": 180.0, "download_slot": "www.foreignaffairs.com", "download_latency":

presidential election, millions of Americans clicked their way through an online flood of disinformation, including the widely distributed falsehood that rampant voter fraud had allowed Joe Biden to steal what was rightfully Donald Trump\u2019s victory. On January 6, 2021, the real-world consequences of this deception and delusion became clear, as thousands of pro-Trump rioters launched a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol, intent on stopping the certification of Biden\u2019s victory.  The siege reflected two important trends that will continue to shape American politics in the coming years. The first is the mainstreaming of right-wing extremism. The majority of the rioters were hitherto ordinary Americans who had only recently embraced radical ideas. Their pathways to political violence did not involve a clearly defined ideology or an affiliation with particular groups but instead were shaped by a propaganda campaign that engulfed the full spectrum of right-wing politics: from Republican elected officials, prominent conservative commentators, and conservative-leaning major news outlets to newly minted social media influencers, minor radical organizations, and a burgeoning group of far-right niche media ventures.  Even before Trump\u2019s rise, these forces had been gaining strength for years owing in part to the so-called war on terror. As I wrote last year in  Foreign Affairs , the post-9/11 era was fertile ground for the far right, when law enforcement and intelligence services focused almost exclusively on the jihadist threat, and the fear of Muslim terrorists played into the hands of xenophobes, white supremacists, and Christian nationalists. Trump took advantage of those developments in his 2016 campaign, and by the time he took office, ideas that had long been relegated to the fringes of American society were rapidly becoming central to the country\u2019s political ecosystem. The mainstreaming of extremism has itself led to the second trend: a scrambling and recombination of extremist groups and ideas. Thanks not only to disinformation about the 2020 election but also to the polarization fed by the  pandemic  and the Black Lives Matter protests, those January 6 rioters who did belong to recognizable far right groups had become accustomed to having strange bedfellows\u2014not just conspiracy theorists enamored of the pro-Trump QAnon movement but also \u201cwellness\u201d advocates opposed to vaccines, libertarians opposed to mask mandates, gun-rights proponents protesting perceived threats to the Second Amendment, and \u201caccelerationists\u201d seeking the violent collapse of political, economic, and social systems.  The post-9/11 era was fertile ground for the far right. These changes have rendered violent extremist movements less coherent and more unpredictable than ever before. In the United States, such groups have generally been defined by relatively clear ideological leanings that aligned with specific intelligence and law enforcement strategies, training needs, and fields of expertise. But tactics such as monitoring, surveillance, and infiltration are harder to apply in an environment that is more spontaneous, fragmented, and characterized by rapid evolution and surprising coalitions. Simply put, the tools that authorities use to combat extremists become less useful when the line between the fringe and the center starts to blur. The federal government urgently needs to adapt to this new reality. Extremism has gone mainstream; so must the interventions needed to address it.  STRANGE BEDFELLOWS Violent movements change in both strategic and organic ways as they make inroads into the mainstream. On the one hand, transformation results from top-down efforts to repackage ideologies to broaden the appeal of ideas the mainstream might otherwise reject. But it\u2019s also caused by the bottom-up fragmentation and reassembling of extreme ideas that happens as people radicalize in a vast and ever-expanding online ecosystem, a process that often involves no contact with particular organizations. Strategic changes are typically rooted in efforts to reach and recruit broader audiences, but in the process, those changes often fundamentally alter fringe movements themselves. For example, the  far right  has historically defended traditional norms regarding families and has opposed policies such as same-sex marriage. But some far-right groups now claim that rights for  women  and LGBTQ people represent core Western values that they aim to protect against a supposed threat from Islam\u2014especially by restricting immigration. Radical nativists have reframed their agenda to appeal to people who care about environmental issues by arguing that border closures or limits on migration will reduce pollution and preserve scarce resources.  Organic changes are more bottom-up in nature, driven by the patchwork essence of an online information ecosystem that easily moves a casual reader across disparate frameworks. Shifts in how extremist propaganda is produced and distributed\u2014fewer manifestos, more memes\u2014have allowed individuals to cleave off bits of ideology and reassemble them into new and unexpected forms. Thus a self-described \u201c Bolshevik \u201d white supremacist group calls for the liquidation of the capitalist class, far-right groups praise the  Taliban  and the  Unabomber , QAnon spreads through yoga studios and alternative medicine communities, and antigovernment militias join forces with left-leaning antivaccine groups to protest restrictions and mandates related to the COVID-19  pandemic .   When it comes to dealing with extremism, other countries are far ahead of the United States. As ordinary individuals encounter these ideas, whether through custom-tailored propaganda or through more grassroots efforts amplified by social media, they assemble them into their own personalized belief systems. This is a far cry from more traditional models of radicalization in which people gradually adopt an identifiable group\u2019s ideological framework\u2014such as fascism or neo-Nazism\u2014that calls for violent solutions against a common enemy. These more coherent processes involve initiation rites, manifestos, leaders, and a chain of command that guide beliefs and actions. Those elements are largely absent from today\u2019s patchwork, choose-your-own-adventure mode of radicalization.  When it comes to dealing with this kind of metastasizing extremism, a number of other countries are far ahead of the United States. They have recognized that the only way to address the mainstreaming of extremist ideas is to focus on the mainstream itself. Canada, Germany, New Zealand, and Norway have all adopted multisectoral approaches, drawing on resources and expertise from as many as a dozen federal agencies, including not only security and intelligence services but ministries of education, labor, health and human services, youth and families, social services, and culture and the arts. They have committed billions of dollars to efforts that build community trust, increase equity and social inclusion,  combat racism , and improve media literacy and civic education so that citizens will be more likely to recognize and resist propaganda, disinformation, and conspiracy theories.  These approaches treat violent extremism less as a security issue than as a societal problem more akin to a public health threat. They integrate counter-extremism and violence prevention into community arts programs, soccer clubs, and interfaith dialogues. Educators, youth social workers, and other practitioners receive regular training\u2014including through state-funded workshops, retreats, and seminars\u2014to improve their knowledge of warning signs, learn about extremist culture, and develop pedagogical strategies. Public funding supports  family counseling  for people who have relationships with radicalized individuals, including their parents, siblings, teachers, and employers. Data on the efficacy of such programs is hard to come by. But when my research lab began to test these models in the United States, my colleagues and I found clear evidence that they work. We created a  guide\u00a0 to equip parents with tools to intervene in youth radicalization and then assessed what more than  750 parents and caregivers  learned from reading it. We found that it took only  seven minutes  of reading for participants to significantly improve their knowledge and understanding of extremism and youth radicalization in ways that make it more likely they would act appropriately when dealing with a young person at risk. More than 80 percent of parents and caregivers reported that, after reading the guide, they felt \u201cdefinitely\u201d or \u201cprobably\u201d prepared to talk with youth about online extremism and to intervene with youth they worried were in contact with extremist ideas. We have had similar success using video content (including animation) and training seminars conducted virtually. A NEW APPROACH In contrast to the holistic approaches pursued by some of its allies and partners, the United States houses its prevention efforts almost exclusively within the Department of Homeland Security. This is because in Washington, countering violent extremism has historically meant focusing more on the violence and less on the extremism. In the post-9/11 era, U.S. officials have essentially measured their success by determining how well they\u2019ve barricaded the doors against violence from an already radicalized or radicalizing fringe. What\u2019s been missing is a strategy to stop people from becoming radicalized in the first place.  There has been some change in the U.S. approach since the January 6 riot. For example, DHS has significantly retooled much of its prevention work, moving experts into regional offices where community-based specialists work more directly with school safety officers, religious leaders, and other practitioners and partners. Last June, the administration released the first-ever U.S. national strategy to counter domestic terrorism, which embraced a public health approach characterized by more interagency collaboration, community-centered prevention, and new investments in media literacy, critical thinking skills, and evidence-based programs to strengthen \u201c user resilience to disinformation and misinformation online .\u201d Notably, the new U.S. strategy directly spells out the need to confront long-term contributors to domestic terrorism,  including racism , easy access to guns, mental illness, and the lack of civics classes in schools. These represent substantial steps forward for a country that has spent decades focused on the security aspects of counterterrorism and combating extremism. But the Biden administration needs to treat this agenda with an even greater sense of urgency. At a minimum, the United States needs a well-resourced interagency task force to carry out the prevention efforts currently controlled exclusively by the security and intelligence sectors. The focus should be on building democratic resilience in the mainstream, not just mitigating the risk of violence from the fringe\u2014with decision-making authority granted to experts in education, social work, and mental health. Washington should also provide significant funding for this kind of work to states and municipalities, making clear that such efforts are more than an afterthought to the security measures on which the United States spends untold billions of dollars.  In the absence of such steps, the risk of more political violence will continue to grow. In a November poll, troublingly low numbers of respondents said they would trust the official results of the 2024 presidential election if their preferred candidate loses: 82 percent of Democrats and only 33 percent of Republicans. If officials can\u2019t find ways to push extremist ideas back to the fringes, the January 6 riot might someday look less like the last gasp of Trump-era extremism and more like a prelude to an era of violent division.

president of the United States, Joe Biden has emphasized that his mission was nothing less than to save the American republic. As he said in his campaign\u2019s launch video, \u201cThe core values of this nation, our standing in the world, our very democracy . . . is at stake.\u201d Biden meant to underscore the threat that former President Donald Trump posed to the United States\u2019 own democratic institutions. But Biden\u2019s concern about democracy also served as the natural framing for his foreign policy. In an international environment in which authoritarians were rapidly gaining in self-confidence and plenty of other major democracies were facing homegrown demagogues, Biden elevated the fight to preserve democratic values to a guiding principle of his presidency. \u201cThe triumph of democracy and liberalism over fascism and autocracy,\u201d Biden wrote in an  essay  for  Foreign Affairs  while still a candidate, \u201ccreated the free world. But this contest does not just define our past. It will define our future.\u201d The ambition of his administration would be nothing less than \u201cto put strengthening democracy back on the global agenda.\u201d To that end, he would quickly convene \u201ca global Summit for Democracy to renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the free world\u201d\u2014a summit happening virtually this week. It is far too early to pass a definitive verdict on whether Biden is on track to live up to the ambitious promises he made as a candidate. He has been in office for less than a year. Many of his appointees still await confirmation by Congress. And the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic makes it especially difficult for an administration to accomplish anything beyond disaster management. But with Biden\u2019s presidency nearing its first anniversary, it is time for a preliminary assessment\u2014and a sobering one at that. So far, the Biden administration has done relatively little to contain the growing ambitions of authoritarian regimes from Russia to China. It has not managed to reduce the danger that populist leaders pose to democratic countries from Hungary to India. And it is very far from helping to restore global trust in the idea of democracy. The reasons for this failure are rooted in objective circumstances over which Biden has little control. The president and his senior officials can\u2019t do much about the United States\u2019 diminished standing in the world, the global resurgence of autocracy, the need to pursue competing foreign policy objectives that are also of genuine importance, Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the election, or his continued hold over the Republican Party. But the administration nonetheless faces a reckoning. Over the past year, it has become amply evident that business as usual will do precious little to help it keep its promises on democracy. Going forward, it should either commit to a more ambitious strategy\u2014or stop pretending. TOUGH WORDS, LITTLE ACTION As president, Trump repeatedly expressed admiration for dictators from Egypt\u2019s Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to Russia\u2019s  Vladimir Putin . Though his administration did take some tough measures to rein in dictatorships that it saw as serious competitors, such as China, the overall impact of his tenure was to embolden autocrats. If dictators were mostly on the defensive in the 1990s, they are now enjoying an astonishing resurgence. As I  wrote  in the pages of  Foreign Affairs  last spring, \u201cThe story of the last two decades is not just one of democratic weakness; it is also one of authoritarian strength.\u201d The rhetorical change that Biden has brought on this front is clear as day. There is no longer any reason for the world to wonder whether the current U.S. leadership stands on the side of democracy or dictatorship. The administration has, while continuing to cooperate on shared interests such as counterterrorism, distanced itself from autocratic leaders in countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. Even in dealing with China, the White House has been strikingly forthright. On topics ranging from the status of Hong Kong to the treatment of ethnic minorities in the country, it has, despite strong pushback from Beijing, stood up for freedom and human rights without mincing words. The administration has also taken some significant steps that go beyond rhetoric when it comes to major authoritarian competitors. It has kept some of the restrictive trade policies the Trump administration adopted and concluded a significant trilateral security pact with Australia and the United Kingdom aimed at countering  China . But on the whole, it remains far from clear whether the Biden administration will accompany tough words about autocrats with actions that are actually capable of keeping their power in check. It has, for example, quietly given up its resistance to the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will give  Russia  more leverage over central Europe. Worse, it has so far proved unable to deter Putin from escalating threats against (what remains of) Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity. Similarly, Biden\u2019s policy on China has not succeeded in stopping the country\u2019s military from performing serious provocations in the  Taiwan  Strait.  Many U.S. allies continue to see the current state of American politics as a cautionary tale. The chaotic way in which the United States withdrew from  Afghanistan  has also undermined the fight against autocracy. Even though Afghanistan was never a truly free society, and it remains too early to predict to what extent the withdrawal will undermine the United States\u2019 security interests, this was a significant setback for Biden\u2019s democracy agenda for three reasons. First, the Taliban have already instituted a nakedly autocratic regime and are in the process of undoing the progress Afghanistan had made on key human rights issues. Second, the manner of the withdrawal\u2014including the United States\u2019 evident miscalculation about the strength of the Afghan government and its security forces\u2014has hurt U.S. credibility. And third, some of the administration\u2019s rhetoric over the summer, which effectively pretended that Americans did not owe much of anything to the Afghans who had fought on their side for 20 years, raised questions about the steadfastness of U.S. commitments. Even as the fall of Kabul is slowly fading from the headlines, this has shaken international trust in the United States\u2019 willingness and capacity to stand by its strategic partners in an hour of need\u2014not just in Europe but also in India, Japan, and beyond. Among many statesmen and policymakers in countries that are closely allied with the United States, there is now a growing sense of concern about the future. The general tenor seems to be that the United States\u2019 \u201cgood face\u201d is back, at least for now. But many of its closest partners seem to wonder: Is the United States\u2019 good face good enough?  A MISSION WITHOUT A STRATEGY  Trump not only expressed fulsome praise for some of the world\u2019s most powerful autocrats, at times he also seemed to hope that more foreign leaders would follow in their footsteps. Throughout his tenure, he undermined key parts of the West\u2019s institutional architecture, such as NATO and the European Union. In many countries, he seemed to ally himself with leaders who were intent on undermining their countries\u2019 democratic institutions, such as India\u2019s Narendra Modi or Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban. Even at home, he practiced what he preached, seeking to politicize independent institutions and pushing back against customary limits on his own power. Here, too, the change of guard in the White House has made a notable difference. It is once again clear that the United States prefers political leaders who strive to make NATO and the EU work. Under Secretary of State Antony Blinken\u2019s leadership, the State Department has become much more active in criticizing assaults on the rule of law or violations of human rights in countries around the world, including those backsliding democracies that are allied with the United States. The Biden administration\u2019s desire to engage in \u201c democracy protection \u201d is not in doubt. What is less clear, however, is whether it has developed any meaningful strategy for how to accomplish such a difficult task. There are many reasons the Biden administration\u2019s attempts at democracy protection have, so far, turned out to be relatively toothless. The authoritarian resurgence is, at least in the short run, giving many American allies a genuine strategic alternative to a close partnership with the United States, making them less susceptible to pressure from the White House or the State Department. The United States needs to work with some of the countries that are experiencing the most pronounced forms of democratic backsliding to serve its key goals and interests, including climate change. (In an attempt to shore up an international alliance against China, the Biden administration has, for example, continued to draw closer to Vietnam\u2019s autocratic one-party government.) U.S. officials are well aware that many of their foreign partners continue to eye the United States with deep skepticism in the wake of Trump\u2019s presidency, making them highly\u2014perhaps overly\u2014cautious about standing up for democratic institutions. And most decisively, the administration simply does not seem to have a coherent plan for how to reshape the incentives of would-be authoritarian leaders in countries such as Poland or India.  Biden was right that democracy is in peril around the world and that the coming decades will prove crucial in deciding its future prospects. All of these problems are on rich display in the planning for the upcoming democracy summit. The list of invited countries, for example, comprises many of the leaders who are doing the most to undermine democracy around the world. From Modi in India to Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil to Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, the  Who\u2019s Who  of international populism will be welcome at the Summit for Democracy. So will the leaders of even more autocratic countries such as Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. (The only two notable countries that are missing from the invite list because they are experiencing significant democratic backsliding are Turkey and Hungary.) These problems also help to explain why the summit aims so low. A two-day virtual summit with over 100 participating countries cannot possibly elicit a real consensus about how to shore up democracy in an age of authoritarian resurgence. Nor are countries likely to be moved to commitments they have not undertaken in advance. And so Biden is poised to announce a few  sensible initiatives  on topics such as corruption during his speech. The administration also hopes to elicit similar commitments from other attendees of the summit, giving governments an incentive to deliver on their promises before the United States convenes a follow-up meeting at some point in the future. But it does not appear likely that Biden will set out a truly novel paradigm for how the international community can work together to preserve democracy. And where the hosts don\u2019t lead, the guests are unlikely to follow. The summit may yet turn out to be a step toward real international cooperation on democracy protection. But at the moment, it seems more likely to have the feel of a campaign promise that needs to be fulfilled without incurring undue embarrassment\u2014before it is promptly forgotten.  TROUBLE ON THE HOME FRONT The third area in which the administration has so far failed to live up to its promise of renewing the spirit of democracy is the one over which Biden has the least control\u2014but it may also be the most important. Styling the 2020 election as a \u201cbattle for the soul of the nation,\u201d the president hoped that a clear victory over Trump could amount to a definitive rebuke of his brand of politics. The Trump presidency would then come to look like a peculiar aberration, and one that likely wouldn\u2019t be repeated anytime soon. Instead, Biden\u2019s victory over Trump has turned out to be far more provisional. His margin of victory was clear but not sufficiently wide to constitute a definitive rebuke of Trumpism. Instead of being cast out from the Republican Party, Trump seems to have strengthened his grip over it. And far from accepting the outcome of a democratic election, many senior Republicans have gone along with their leader\u2019s lie that its outcome was fraudulent and are now using their control of many state legislatures to politicize the manner in which election results are certified. The 2020 election might have been a monument to the way in which democracies can mediate deep political conflicts. Instead, it now serves as a reminder about how easily shameless partisans can undermine public trust in long-standing institutions and an urgent warning for the even more grave constitutional crisis that may await the United States in 2024. As a result, many U.S. allies continue to see the current state of American politics as a cautionary tale. So long as the United States remains as deeply divided as it now is\u2014and some political actors remain as unwilling to acknowledge the legitimacy of its most basic institutions as they now are\u2014no leader of the country, however well-intentioned, is likely to inspire a revival of global faith in democracy. UNKEPT PROMISES Biden was right that democracy is in peril around the world and that the coming decades will prove crucial in deciding its future prospects. But it is also becoming clear that he underestimated the obstacles that stand in the way of a well-meaning president doing anything about that. As a result, he has vastly overpromised on the contribution that his administration could make to shoring up democracy. It\u2019s time for the administration to limit the scope of its ambitions. Under current circumstances, democracy protection is both more feasible and more urgent than democracy promotion; the United States\u2019 focus should be not on bringing long-standing autocracies into the democratic fold but rather on ensuring that long-standing democracies don\u2019t backslide and that autocracies don\u2019t expand their sphere of influence. But even with this narrower scope, the United Sates faces a much starker choice than Biden has so far acknowledged. If he is serious about doing anything meaningful to help democracies around the world endure in an age of rising autocracy, he must go beyond business as usual. A meaningful democracy agenda would require the United States to demonstrate that populist leaders who are assaulting their countries\u2019 free institutions will reap serious adverse consequences, not an invitation to the White House\u2019s Summit for Democracy. It would require the country to commit to prioritizing cooperation with true  democracies  while, of course, maintaining a lesser form of partnership with other allies. And it would require the president to set out a vision for how international institutions that are being subverted by antidemocratic leaders in their own midst, such as NATO, can be reformed or refounded. Such an ambitious course of action would have serious drawbacks. And even if it is attempted, it might not succeed. But the very least that U.S. leaders can do is to be honest with themselves, the country, and the world. If the Biden administration has decided that the steps that are required to make a real difference in the contest between \u201cdemocracy and liberalism\u201d and \u201cfascism and autocracy\u201d are not worth the cost, it should come out and say so.

The Biden administration has kept in place its predecessor\u2019s onerous tariffs on Chinese imports, electing to use pressure to change Beijing\u2019s behavior and to protect U.S. interests. China, U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters in February, is his country\u2019s most \u201cserious competitor,\u201d one that threatens the United States\u2019 \u201cprosperity, security, and democratic values.\u201d  Whatever the merits of this rhetoric and approach, China\u2019s rise has certainly hurt U.S. manufacturing regions. There is now an enormous body of evidence showing that import competition from China has gutted industrial towns in the American Midwest and Southeast. Five years ago, David Autor, David Dorn, and I reported that between 1999 and 2011, trade with China appeared to have cost the United States between 600,000 and one million manufacturing jobs, as large U.S. producers were driven out of business by competitors with more affordable Chinese-made products or as they moved their own plants overseas. In new research, we have extended our analysis out to 2019. The picture remains bleak. Most places hurt by the \u201cChina shock,\u201d as the phenomenon is now known, have seen little in the way of recovery. At least in part, the recognition of these losses motivated the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China. But research shows that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have done little to reverse the economic and social damage suffered in communities that lost industrial jobs thanks to China\u2019s boom. Joblessness remains high in impacted regions. Marriage rates have dropped, families headed by single parents have become more common, and more children are living in poverty. Rates of substance abuse have gone up, and thousands of people have died from opioid overdoses. The China trade shock has proved far more durable and powerful than initially imagined. This experience is important to remember as U.S. policymakers chart out what could be an equally seismic economic shift: moving the United States away from fossil fuels and toward greener sources of energy. Such a transition may be critical to fight climate change, but it could devastate parts of the country that depend on carbon extraction. In 2019, 2.8 million people worked for companies that extract, process, distribute, and produce electricity from fossil fuels. Many other employers depended on spending by these workers to stay in business. To avoid creating yet more social havoc, the United States must learn from its past mistakes. Rather than counting on markets to sort out the aftermath of shocks, the government will need to proactively invest in policies designed to help regions that bear the brunt of wider transformations in the economy. It will need to design a social welfare system that recognizes that not every community suffers equally and that even when the national economy is growing, some places still struggle. Otherwise, millions more people could be left behind. A VICIOUS CYCLE The China trade shock began in earnest around 1992, when the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping momentously expanded China\u2019s economic reforms to include freer trade and investment with the outside world. From the late 1990s through the early 2000s, industry towns such as Hickory, North Carolina, and St. Marys, Pennsylvania, saw factories close, manufacturing jobs disappear, and housing prices fall. Residents without college degrees watched their middle-class status\u2014or their hopes of reaching the middle class\u2014evaporate.  By 2010, China\u2019s share of the U.S. market for various products began to stabilize, and U.S.-based manufacturers stopped laying off large numbers of workers. Many policymakers hoped that as a result, life would begin to improve in former factory communities. But as Autor, Dorn, and I found in our new study, such relief did not arrive. We looked at labor-market outcomes in U.S. factory towns from 2000 to 2019. Our findings went against cherished economic frameworks, which predict that workers in struggling communities migrate in search of employment elsewhere and that new industries expand into downtrodden areas to take advantage of an idle labor pool. Neither type of recovery materialized. Overall, relatively small percentages of people left their communities, and businesses didn\u2019t expand enough to absorb workers who had earlier lost their jobs. Economists still can\u2019t explain why workers did not abandon regions in decline, but relationships may play a role. Moving can mean separating from family members, who care for children, provide support when times are tough, and offer a comforting social network.    Manufacturing layoffs initiated a downward spiral of economic distress and social breakdown. Although the magnitude of manufacturing job loss has been plain to see, many academics and inside-the-Beltway policy analysts have nonetheless downplayed the hollowing out of the heartland. The U.S. economy is dynamic, creating and destroying millions of jobs annually, and so for some, the woes of factory towns seem somewhat inconsequential. Others have argued that the decline of manufacturing employment was inevitable; irrespective of  China\u2019s rise , automation and artificial intelligence would ultimately cause factory jobs to disappear. But these skeptics fail to appreciate just how acute and concentrated the China trade shock was in both time and place. Because China reformed its economy so quickly, manufacturing cities and towns lost their jobs at an equally brisk pace\u2014far faster than would have been the case even under the grimmest automation timeline. And because many communities in the American Midwest and Southeast were heavily dependent on a narrow range of industries, the losses were profound, and their populations had no good Plan B. Instead, manufacturing layoffs morphed into overall regional joblessness and lower wages, initiating a downward spiral of economic distress and social breakdown. Consider again Hickory, North Carolina, which anchors a region of 380,000 people and was ground zero for the China trade shock. In 1990, 36 percent of the town\u2019s labor force was employed in manufacturing, mostly in making furniture. But by 2019, after decades of offshoring, just 18 percent of Hickory\u2019s workers still had factory jobs. This dramatic decline would have hit any community hard, but it was especially devastating in such a highly specialized region. Just 16 percent of Hickory\u2019s working-age population had college degrees, making it very difficult for most residents to find new, well-paying employment opportunities. The overall employment rate has since dropped by an alarming seven percentage points. Yet in 2019, Hickory\u2019s working-age population was no smaller than it had been in 2010. Policy at the national level can very easily overlook places such as Hickory. Major economic contractions prompt government action. A  recession  can force Congress, for instance, to extend the duration of unemployment benefits beyond the standard six months or increase the generosity of these benefits\u2014as it did in response to the COVID-19 crisis. But the bulk of the job losses induced by the China trade shock occurred in the early 2000s, during a modest national economic expansion. Looking at the forest and not the trees, the federal government paid little attention to the suffering of particular regions. Workers in distressed local economies were largely left to go it alone.  COLLATERAL DAMAGE The extreme job losses caused by hyperglobalization may be in the past. But the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, whether via the Build Back Better legislation currently before Congress or through other regulations, could initiate another round of regionalized labor-market disruptions. There are plenty of local economies that still mine coal, drill for oil and gas, and create electricity from these sources. There are plenty more that depend on carbon-intensive industries such as cement and steel, which require enormous amounts of energy to produce. For all the good that decarbonization would do for  the world , it represents a seemingly existential threat to these communities. Compounding the potential misery, fossil-fuel-dependent communities in the Midwest sit uncomfortably close to many of the places that were hardest hit by the China trade shock. The regional manufacturing collapse that punished an older cohort of workers may be followed by an energy transformation that punishes a younger group.  To see why the energy transition could cause so much damage, look back to the decline of coal mining after 1980, when the collapse of oil prices sent the industry into a tailspin. Between 1980 and 1990, national employment in coal mining sank from 264,000 to 151,000 workers, before dropping another 71,000 workers in the ensuing decade. Although the industry recovered modestly in the early 2000s, employment in coal plunged again after 2010. In a manner qualitatively similar to the China trade shock (but on a much smaller scale), job losses were concentrated in the Midwest and the South\u2014namely, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia\u2014and overall employment remained depressed all the way through the 2000s, nearly three decades after the decline in mining had begun. That is again because, unlike what economic models would predict, new or existing industries did not flock to coal towns to hire laid-off workers. Nor did the decline of those industries prompt an exodus of workers; outmigration became sizable only after 2010. People had a hard time leaving places their families had called home for generations. The geographic concentration of industries that extract, refine, and utilize fossil fuels should be of immediate concern to policymakers intent on decarbonizing the U.S. economy. Increased demand for renewable energy will create new jobs in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, but these jobs may be located far from existing carbon-based production facilities. New power-intensive industries, such as data centers, may choose to be situated near renewable energy providers, which could also make it more difficult for laid-off workers to find other jobs.   Miners, drillers, or frackers don't have to be sacrificed for a green future. But that doesn\u2019t mean miners, drillers, or frackers have to be sacrificed at the altar of a green future. Policymakers have the tools to help workers hurt by the  energy transition . If the government pays attention to the woes of local communities and proactively addresses them, it can spare these places from experiencing a fate similar to that of the China shock. U.S. policymakers must respond aggressively to localized job losses irrespective of how the national economy is performing. To do so, the government should make the duration and generosity of unemployment benefits depend on regional rather than national economic conditions: losing a job is simply more painful in local economies where unemployment is already high. The government could also launch a system of national wage insurance, which would buttress the incomes of workers who experience sharp declines in pay, thus protecting against the financial insecurity caused by precarious labor markets.  But expanding the  safety net  is just one part of the equation. To prevent regional recessions, the government will need to move quickly to encourage new employment in places where jobs disappear en masse. That means taking place-based policies more seriously. One promising example is active labor-market programs, including targeted sectoral training, which provide workers with the skills demanded by industries set to expand nationally. In Northeast Ohio, for instance, the WorkAdvance Program, studied by a group of scholars at Harvard, partnered with local employers in health care and other sectors to identify what skills they required and then helped young workers without a college degree acquire them. The program also supplied these workers with placement services and career coaching. Two years later, the trainees had 14 percent higher earnings than similar workers who did not receive training. These efforts need not bust the bank. Many cities and states spend more on tax incentives to lure trophy companies such as Amazon or, more notoriously, Foxconn to their jurisdictions. Diverting funds to improve the capabilities of workers and businesses already in these communities would be cheaper, more effective, and more ethical.  Without such preparations, the energy transition may add to the unfortunate and painful history of regionalized joblessness.  It could fuel more misery, broken families, and addiction. Regional economic divides have intensified political polarization in the United States and provided fertile ground for populists. If the federal government is serious about decarbonizing the U.S. economy, then it must also get serious about helping people who will lose their jobs in the process.

President Donald Trump\u2019s devotees announced well in advance what they were going to do, and then they did it. Explanations of how things got that far tend to focus on people\u2014be it Trump himself, with his ability to inspire cultish devotion, or Twitter and Facebook mobs summoned from the netherworlds of the Internet. But little attention has been paid to the role of a very old-fashioned institution: the political party. The elephant in the room is the Republican Party. It gave up on the basic idea that in a democracy, parties try to gain majority support through an attractive program. Within its own ranks, it left no space for debate. Instead of a laboratory for designing policies to address actual problems, the party served as a cult of personality around Trump. The only real agenda of its leader was to wage a culture war on behalf of \u201creal\u201d Americans against those who supposedly posed an existential threat to them, from  immigrants  to so-called globalists. A year after January 6, little has changed. Today, the Trumpists are doubling down on voter suppression and subverting elections whose outcomes are not to their liking. As the alarms flash red, it is time to take inspiration from other democracies that have built safeguards into their political systems by regulating their parties. For as long as one party in a two-party system is no longer playing by the most basic rules of the democratic game, the American republic remains at risk.  THE CULT OF TRUMP According to the conventional wisdom that reigned for much of the past century, a two-party system automatically constituted a bulwark against political extremism: those aspiring to win at the ballot box had to create a broad ideological tent and opt for moderation to capture centrist voters. The defeats of radicals such as Barry Goldwater (who accepted the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for president in 1964 by announcing, \u201cextremism in the defense of liberty is no vice\u201d) seemed to only reinforce the inherent superiority of American democracy. This system was said to ensure not only stability but also accountability. Because one party, as opposed to a large coalition, was responsible for governing, if what the incumbents did proved unpopular with most people, a majority would throw the bums out and give the other side a chance.  The past few decades\u2014not just the Trump years\u2014have shown that the reality can be rather different and that the institutional guarantees of democracy are far weaker than experts imagined. Some of the structural problems go back to the very beginning. The founders did not create the two-party system; in fact, they wanted to avoid what they derided as \u201cfactions.\u201d But they wrote a constitution that ensured that not all votes would count equally. Rural areas are massively overrepresented, with the result that Republicans can easily gain majorities in the Senate even if far fewer people vote for them. Thanks to the peculiarities of the Electoral College, they can win the presidency on the basis of only minority support in the country as a whole. Add to that relentless gerrymandering, which creates ideological playgrounds for extremists, and a self-enclosed right-wing media world whose main purpose is political self-validation, and the overall consequence is something the founders feared as much as the tyranny of the majority: a tyranny of a minority that believes itself to be the only true Americans. The GOP today is a hollow shell. One of its major shortcomings is its lack of what political scientists call \u201c intraparty democracy \u201d\u2014the degree to which a party allows for deliberation about policy, chooses leaders in a democratic manner, and holds them accountable. Intraparty democracy sounds like the kind of pious demand that gives democratic theorists a bad name among hard-nosed politicians. (It brings to mind Oscar Wilde\u2019s supposed quip, \u201cThe trouble with socialism is that it takes up too many evenings.\u201d) But parties that operate democratically on the inside are more likely to both generate innovative policies and foster tolerant, democratic attitudes among their members. True, people associate politically because they believe in particular principles and not because they want to be infinitely tolerant. But principles do not implement themselves, nor do they magically generate actual political strategies. One needs to argue over these things, which means that ideally, one gets used to the idea that those who disagree might be right. As a consequence, those who lose a fight can adopt a stance of loyal opposition inside an organization based on shared principles.  There is something inherently problematic about parties that have only one member. In the Netherlands, for example, Geert Wilders\u2019s right-wing populist party has just one member: Wilders himself, with the party\u2019s deputies in Parliament being representatives and not actual party members. Parties that are internally autocratic are also likely to act in authoritarian ways once they get hold of the levers of power. It is hardly an accident that far-right authoritarian populists\u2014including Viktor Orban of Hungary, Narendra Modi of India, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey\u2014also lead their parties in a highly dictatorial manner. Rather than party fragmentation being a danger to democracy, what can more positively be described as \u201cinternal pluralism\u201d is a precondition for its health.  The Republicans\u2019 current program is both unpopular and intellectually bankrupt. That is why some democracies, such as Spain and Germany, even  prescribe  intraparty democracy in their constitutions. Statutes spell out details such as how frequently internal elections must be held. These laws also specify substantive grounds for prohibiting parties. Spain banned a Basque party in 2003 for its tacit support of terrorism. Germany\u2019s constitutional court cut off a neo-Nazi party from public financing in 2017 because its aims were deemed hostile to the German constitution. Trump managed to transform the Republican Party into a personality cult. Anything like critical loyalty to the party but not the person, let alone outright opposition, has been rendered impossible. One simply cannot be a Republican in good standing and a powerful critic of the former president. The result? There were no genuine restraints on Trump in the run-up to January 6. Although Trump\u2019s long-standing enablers, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, had acknowledged Joe Biden\u2019s victory by December 2020, no one of prominence dared to forcefully call for an end to the \u201cstop the steal\u201d farce. The few dissenters have been banished to the political wilderness or kicked out of the party altogether. After Liz Cheney, Wyoming\u2019s sole member of the House of Representatives, voted to impeach Trump for his role in the January 6 attack, the state\u2019s Republican Party decided to no longer recognize her as a Republican.  Why did  Republican Party  elites prove so willing to fall in line with Trump? Their opportunism is surely related to the GOP\u2019s long-standing inability to formulate a genuine party program. At its convention in August 2020, in fact, Republicans refused to issue a new platform, instead simply affirming their fealty to the president. The political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have called the Republicans\u2019 current program \u201c plutocratic populism .\u201d It is both unpopular and intellectually bankrupt: beyond tax cuts for the  wealthiest , there simply is no there there. As Hacker and Pierson have pointed out, this approach, combined with the structural factors favoring a tyranny of the minority, can certainly yield election victories. Citizens can be distracted by endless culture wars or by the outright incitement of hatred against liberals and  Black  and brown minorities in defense of a supposed white Christian heartland. But at the end of the day, plutocratic populism does not amount to a coherent program that can be confidently defended in public. Again, as high-minded as democratic theorists\u2019 demands for coherent party programs can sound, their absence clearly contributed to January 6. Proper political parties can cope with losing elections, because they have principled commitments and long timelines for their implementation. A personality cult, by contrast, must inevitably reckon with the lifespan of the cult leader. A man in his seventies who has no apparent goals apart from social dominance and self-enrichment thinks about an election loss differently than does a party with successive leaders looking to realize the party\u2019s core beliefs over long stretches of time. NEVER AGAIN What to do? The first thing is to recognize the gravity of the challenge. In countries where courts can prohibit antidemocratic parties\u2014such as Spain and Germany\u2014the Republican Party would probably have been banned by now, since many of its leading figures have refused to condemn the violence of January 6. Setting aside the question of whether such a ban would be legal, the idea of political intolerance for the sake of defending democracy is hardly alien to the United States: the 1954 Communist Control Act sought to outlaw the  Communist Party  of the United States on the grounds that it aimed to \u201coverthrow the government.\u201d One can question whether McCarthyism provides a good template for protecting a system of self-government, but what is beyond debate is that banning one party in a two-party system might possibly start a civil war.  That does not justify defeatism. The Select Committee investigating January 6 can achieve maximum clarity about the events of that day and bring maximum pressure on those even indirectly responsible. The Justice Department should not just go after the foot soldiers of the insurrection but also uncover the conspiracies and support that came from the very top and prosecute accordingly. At a less official level, many actors who still treat the GOP as if it were a normal democratic party\u2014in particular, journalists striving for the kind of balance appropriate to a traditional democratic two-party system\u2014should shift their lens and do more to hold its leaders to account. That doesn\u2019t mean that every Republican policy must be framed as undemocratic, but it does mean forcing the party\u2019s figures to come clean on their relationship to Trump. How January 6 is described by them is as good a litmus test as any. If a Republican describes the events of that day as a peaceful patriotic protest, then journalists should make that known and point out that politicians spouting such falsehoods today are likely to undermine democracy further tomorrow. Less obvious, the regrouping of antidemocratic movements at the local level needs to be watched closely. The Proud Boys, for example, have  shifted  their focus to town councils and school boards. In democracies that allow for the banning of political parties, it is widely recognized that even if extremist groups might not elect leaders to the national government, they can still sow hatred and instigate violence at the local level. Invoking a law passed by Congress in 1871 to combat the Ku Klux Klan, Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., has wisely decided to file a civil lawsuit against the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. The 14th Amendment bars those who swore an oath to the Constitution and yet \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion\u201d from holding office again. This clause can and should be used against the politicians responsible for January 6.  Politicians who undermine or destroy democracy ought to be disqualified from office. If Trumpism is a cult, some of the lessons of how people exit cults\u2014or admit to themselves that the leaders in which they had unconditional trust deceived them\u2014are also relevant. More thought should be put into the issue of how to provide safe spaces for Trump\u2019s followers to admit to themselves and others that they have been duped, be it about contributions that just ended up enriching the president and his cronies or about  COVID-19 denial  that ended up killing their friends and family. In practice, that means neighborhood get-togethers in which people can speak to those they trust, as opposed to toxic spats on Twitter and  Facebook . This is not to say that every Republican voter is a therapy case to be cured by Democratic deprogrammers. Still, people who feel so existentially threatened that they are ready to take up arms\u2014as a significant number of Republicans do\u2014have more in common with sympathizers of terrorist organizations than with committed partisans in a functioning democracy. If a politically quieter, saner moment were ever to arrive, the United States could finally tackle pressing structural issues, as well. Gerrymandering is not prescribed by the Constitution, nor are single-member districts. Even short of abolishing the Electoral College\u2014or at least possibly lessening the minority-rule problem by making Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico states\u2014there are ways to provide incentives for all parties to aim at winning majorities. The United States should experiment with ranked-choice voting in multimember districts, and it should shift comprehensively to having independent commissions, rather than state legislatures, determine the shape of such districts. Nobody can force Republicans to have a genuine party program, but one can provide plenty of incentives for them to appeal to the majority. Lastly, there is a more direct approach that should be tried: politicians who conspire to undermine or outright destroy democracy ought to be  disqualified  from holding office, be it through impeachment or conviction in the courts. The best candidate for this treatment is the man most responsible for January 6: Donald Trump. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

LinkedIn Get a link Get Citation Request Reprint Permissions More than any constitution or law, democracy rests on what the late political scientist Robert Dahl called a \u201csystem of mutual security.\u201d Each side in the democratic contest must have confidence that the other side will play by the rules of the democratic game, accept defeat if that is its fate, and return to fight another day. The political fight must be restrained by mutual respect, mutual trust, and mutual restraint\u2014respect for the right of opposing political forces to contest and criticize, trust that the other side will not eliminate it if it comes to power, and restraint in the methods used to contest for and hold power. No democracy can long survive a political atmosphere devoid of these norms. Yet that is the abyss into which American democracy is descending.  One year ago today, the United States suffered its most serious brush with constitutional failure since the Civil War. Many things remain unknown about the tragic and horrifying assault on the U.S. Capitol. There is no doubt, however, about the scale of the violence or about how close the United States came to seeing the peaceful transfer of power sabotaged for the first time in the country\u2019s history.  The  damage  of former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Lie\u201d\u2014that he did not really lose the 2020 presidential election\u2014has been poisonous and long lasting. Most Republicans and up to a third of the American public do not believe that President Joe Biden was legitimately elected. And a variety of different polls, using varying wording and methodologies, have all documented a growing willingness of the American people to consider or condone political violence. When the polarization between two political camps reaches the point that each side regards the other as morally intolerable, as an existential threat to the country\u2019s future, democracy is at risk.  The January 6 insurrection was neither the beginning nor the end of this descent. For some two decades, political scientists have been worrying about the growing polarization of American politics, as evidenced in rising congressional gridlock, an unwillingness to compromise, and the maximalist, take-no-prisoners tone of cable news, talk radio, and social media. Well before Trump began to use the power and prestige of the presidency to trample on democratic norms, ratings agencies noted a decline in the quality of U.S. democracy. Analysts at Freedom House have shown the decline unfolding steadily between 2010 and 2020, dropping the country\u2019s \u201cfreedom score\u201d by 11 points\u2014from 94 to 83\u2014on a 100-point scale. Due in part to eroding public trust in democratic institutions, the Economist Intelligence Unit downgraded the United States to a \u201cflawed democracy\u201d in 2017. And in 2020, International IDEA (Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance), a widely respected international think tank focused on democratic development, classified the United States as a \u201cbacksliding democracy.\u201d  Among Washington\u2019s democratic allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific region, as well as many emerging democracies worldwide, there is mounting concern, even alarm, at the deeply troubled state of democracy in the United States. As Americans tear their own country apart, fragile democracies are retreating before a tide of illiberal populism, dictatorships in China and  Russia  are surging in power and ambition, and the norms and restraints of the post\u2013World War II liberal order\u2014including the indispensable norm against territorial aggression\u2014are crumbling. Last month, the Biden administration finally held its long-awaited Summit for Democracy to rally international resolve and push back against the illiberal tide. It was an important symbolic step, because despite the collective weight of the European Union and the geopolitical courage and generous assistance of small European democracies such as the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden\u2014which refuse to be cowed by  China  and Russia\u2014the United States remains the world\u2019s most important democratic bulwark. A global democratic countermovement will find its energy and conviction challenged, however, as long as it depends for leadership on a democracy as troubled as the United States. This is the paradox of global democracy today: the fate of freedom still rests on a deeply flawed and unstable democratic superpower. Inside that paradox rests a series of other paradoxes\u2014a set of sobering obstacles to the dream of global democratic renewal. BACKSLIDIN\u2019 AWAY The first of these paradoxes is that reviving democracy in the United States requires depolarization and hence compromises that can bridge partisan divides and build coalitions from the center out. Compromise suggests a middle ground between two poles and actors on each side willing to seize that ground. But a key feature of the country\u2019s democratic crisis is that one of the two major political parties is undermining the essential conditions for free and fair elections, particularly neutral and nonpartisan procedures for administering and certifying elections. In the year since January 6, numerous U.S. states have seen Republican legislators push and in some cases adopt  laws  enabling them to assert partisan control over the electoral process and thus possibly to reverse the results of a free and fair election. And even more states have adopted provisions that make voting more difficult for the kinds of people who tend to favor the other party.  There exists a legislative remedy to this threat to democracy: the Freedom to Vote Act, forged through compromise between progressive and moderate Democratic U.S. senators. It would address not only the rising dangers of voter suppression and partisan sabotage of the electoral process but two other scourges of American democracy, gerrymandering and dark money. It would bring American democracy at least somewhat closer to the standards of impartial, independent, professional election administration that make this vital function noncontroversial in wealthy democracies, such as Australia,  Canada , Japan, the  United Kingdom , Taiwan, and most EU members, and even in  numerous  less prosperous democracies, including Costa Rica, India, and Mexico. \u00a0 Yet the Freedom to Vote Act lacks support from even a single Republican in the U.S. Senate. Hence it can be adopted only by removing one of the most arcane and dysfunctional features of American democracy, the Senate filibuster. This raises a second paradox. Although it has been for some two centuries a model and inspiration for emerging democracies, the U.S. system has grown stale in its resistance to reform and has failed to keep pace with global democratic innovations. The United States lacks many of the national institutions of accountability and good governance that are common in peer democracies, such as an independent anticorruption commission, a human rights commission, and an ombudsman to investigate citizen complaints. The country remains stuck with a \u201cfirst past the post\u201d electoral system that has been rigged for partisan advantage via redistricting and that is highly vulnerable to polarization, because it tends to entrench just two political parties: voters usually reject third-party options so that they do not \u201cwaste\u201d their votes.   On January 6, the United States suffered its most serious brush with constitutional failure since the Civil War. During much of the twentieth century, the two parties competed for \u201cmedian\u201d voters and kept more radical tendencies at bay\u2014albeit at the horrible price of ignoring pervasive racial discrimination and Black disenfranchisement in the South. But as realignment occurred beginning in the late 1960s, parties became more coherent, primaries increasingly selected more partisan and ideological nominees, and congressional compromises got harder and harder to forge. In truth, however, the problem runs even deeper. In the Senate, the filibuster now blocks political reform, but institutional reform was slow even before the filibuster became (only in recent decades) an automatic requirement for legislation. Hence a third paradox: although the United States holds itself up as a model of democratic experimentation and adaptation, the U.S. \u00a0Constitution is among the world\u2019s most difficult to amend. Dramatic change often requires decades of advocacy and mobilization of the kinds that produced female suffrage and equal rights for racial minorities.  Of course, reform can happen incrementally, state by state. Alaska and Maine have recently adopted an electoral reform called ranked-choice voting, which offers real promise of reducing polarization. Under that system, it makes sense for independents and third-party candidates to run for office and for dissatisfied voters to vote for them, because no votes are \u201cwasted.\u201d Instead of voting for just one candidate, voters rank their choices, and if no one wins a majority of first-preference votes, the least popular candidates are eliminated and lower-preference votes are counted in \u201cinstant runoffs\u201d until someone wins a majority. This and other options, including various systems of proportional representation that could replace \u201cfirst past the post\u201d in multimember congressional districts, offer the best long-term prospect of reducing the country\u2019s polarization.  And then consider a fourth paradox: although voter suppression and electoral subversion now seriously threaten U.S. democracy, the country\u2019s flawed electoral processes still offer the best hope of arresting democratic decay. Other countries have transcended this paradox to preserve or revive democracy. In India in the mid-1970s, Chile in the late 1980s, Mexico in 2000, and more recently in Peru, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, and Zambia, authoritarian regimes and illiberal forces were defeated through broad and resolute electoral mobilization. Today, opposition blocs in Hungary and Turkey are mobilizing to the same end, facing long odds against regimes that have stacked the decks in their own favor.  A crucial lesson emerges from these diverse circumstances. People do not generally cast their votes for or against  democracy ; the abuse of power has to get very bad and typically remain bad for a long time before it will become the dominant issue. So political forces seeking to defend or renew  democracy  must speak to other issues, in particular the economy, and they must craft the broadest possible coalitions in doing so. This requires going against the trend of polarization by showing respect for the concerns of people who previously backed illiberal options. In the 2019 municipal elections in Turkey, the opposition made stunning gains against the ruling authoritarian party by crafting just such an inclusive campaign. Leaders dubbed their strategy \u201c radical love .\u201d In Hungary, in the recent primary to nominate a candidate to face Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the coming parliamentary elections, the country\u2019s disparate, six-party opposition coalition took a similar approach, choosing the centrist outsider Peter Marki-Zay, the mayor of a small provincial city. Marki-Zay is promising a return to Europe and accountable government\u2014but with a populist edge.  WE\u2019RE GONNA NEED A BIGGER BASE And therein lies perhaps the most difficult and important paradox of all: sometimes, it takes a dose of populism to fight populism. Although successful pushbacks against illiberalism must bridge partisan polarization, they often triumph by condemning corruption and crony capitalism and by mounting appeals to economic fairness and inclusion\u2014promises also made by aspiring autocrats, who abandon them once in power and divert attention from their policy failures and limitations through appeals to identity and cultural grievance. Democracy\u2019s defenders need to avoid the brutal  divisiveness , contempt for institutions, intolerance of pluralism, and exaltation of the leader that define illiberal populism. But they should try to energize voters by expressing moral outrage and empathy for people\u2019s insecurity and loss and, when possible, by putting forward charismatic candidates who embody a message of change. Such a strategy lifted the environmental activist Zuzana  Caputova\u00a0to the presidency of Slovakia in 2019, and it now gives opposition parties a fighting chance of winning electoral victories in Hungary, Poland, and Turkey. Broadening the base of support for democratic reform is  crucial , because authoritarians and illiberal democrats always seek to tilt the political playing field to a degree that requires the opposition to win a larger than normal victory. Oppositions that dismiss this danger\u2014and fail to transcend their own divisions and alternative identity claims\u2014typically falter.  As Americans tear their own country apart, fragile democracies are retreating before a tide of illiberal populism. The January 6 insurrection was the product of a  political climate , if not a political plot, intentionally produced by an authoritarian populist leader and movement. Trump may well seek a return to the White House, this time with a leg up in critical battleground states where his Republican allies have made it easier to invalidate the legitimate results of elections. To defeat his brand of populism, Democrats need to avoid militant appeals to identity-based grievances that illiberal populists seize on to paint Democrats as advocates of \u201c cancel culture ,\u201d \u201creverse discrimination,\u201d and efforts to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d In addition to fighting against racial exclusion and prosecuting violent white nationalism, Democrats should borrow a page from New York City Mayor Eric Adams\u2019s playbook and get tough on crime. The radical right will seek to stoke racial anxiety in any case, but Democrats shouldn\u2019t make it easier for that message to resonate with swing voters.  In 2022 and 2024, elections must be squarely focused on the question of which party offers the people a fairer economic deal. Shifting away from identity politics would go against the grain of the moment, which is defined by demographic change and social media passions. It would require a disciplined focus on job creation, childcare support, early childhood education, health-care expansion, infrastructure investment, the new green economy, and bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. The three Democratic presidents who managed to serve two full terms in the last century\u2014Franklin Roosevelt, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama\u2014all understood the need for a message of hope and optimism focused on bread-and-butter economic issues. Democratic success might also require a presidential candidate who can craft an outsider, anti-elite image more authentic and persuasive than the one Trump has perfected\u2014but shorn of illiberal tendencies. In the near term, that might be the hardest paradox for American democracy to overcome. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

Joe Biden and Boris Johnson make an odd couple. Whereas Donald Trump and the British prime minister shared a populist flair and became pals across the pond, \u201cMiddle-Class Joe\u201d and the scandal-plagued Etonian cut a more awkward pair. The two leaders have faced similar domestic challenges over the last year, including deep political and social divisions and a resurgent pandemic, but they have found themselves at odds over the consequences of Brexit and the aftershocks of Trump\u2019s foreign policy. The absence of any deep affinity between their senior teams has not helped, either. Lesser partnerships might have suffered irreparable damage. But in the United Kingdom, pragmatism prevailed, as it nearly always does. Through sheer determination, Johnson has forged a strong partnership with his unlikely opposite number in the United States and largely aligned his foreign policy with Biden\u2019s. Although tensions over Northern Ireland persist, the prospects for a U.S.-British trade deal are stalled, and the two countries have diverged on free trade in general, Johnson has mostly embraced Washington\u2019s larger objectives vis-\u00e0-vis China and Russia. In the current  standoff with Russia  over Ukraine, the United Kingdom\u2019s emphasis on deterrence stands in stark contrast to France\u2019s impulse to negotiate and Germany\u2019s ambivalence. There is no doubt which of these powers is Washington\u2019s closest European security partner.  The paradox, of course, is that Johnson has spent most of the last two and a half years crowing about \u201cglobal Britain\u201d and its newly independent foreign policy. For this reason, his government\u2019s rhetoric (and conspicuous silence on certain matters) is still out of sync with reality. In an address to the Conservative Party Conference, for instance, British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the United States was \u201cspecial but not exclusive,\u201d and in a major foreign policy speech at Chatham House, Truss said virtually nothing about the United States. But the reality is that for all Johnson\u2019s bluster about global Britain, Brexit has only increased the United Kingdom\u2019s dependence on the United States. Still, neither Washington nor London should take their historic partnership for granted. Despite decades of shared interests and a common worldview built on deeply held liberal values, the United Kingdom and the United States have lately been distracted by domestic turmoil and international crises and needed daily diplomacy to keep their relationship on track. Both countries should therefore recommit to strengthening their partnership, building on the momentum of last year\u2019s G-7 summit in the United Kingdom, where  Biden  and Johnson signed a new Atlantic Charter setting out their joint ambitions. That, in turn, will require the United Kingdom and the United States to fortify their democracies and build unity at home. Doing so will not only guard against external interference by autocratic powers but also help restore the symbolic power of liberal democracy around the world.  CONTINENTAL DRIFT After four years of Brexit politics in the United Kingdom and Trumpism in the United States, any effort to reinvigorate the strategic partnership between London and Washington was not going to be easy. Among the issues on which they were misaligned was trade relations. In addition to renegotiating economic relations with Europe, Johnson made it a cornerstone of his agenda to secure a free trade deal with the United States. But by leaving the EU, Johnson increased the United Kingdom\u2019s economic independence at the expense of its economic utility to the United States.  Trump\u2019s preference for Brexit meant that Washington dangled the idea of a trade deal, at least for a time. But the negotiations that led to the 2020 EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which now forms the basis of the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union, dominated British politics for more than four years. For its part, the United States was also consumed by its domestic affairs, first because of Trump\u2019s various scandals and then because of COVID-19. Trump also spent four years fomenting opposition to free trade, helping to entrench a deep skepticism toward free trade in Congress. Johnson\u2019s final effort to forge a deal with the EU before its scheduled departure from the bloc\u2019s single market and customs union took place just after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as Republican leaders across the United States launched a series of legal challenges seeking to overturn the results. Days later, an insurrection erupted at the U.S. Capitol as rioters sought to prevent Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s victory.   Johnson has forged a strong partnership with his unlikely opposite number in the United States. Throughout the U.S. election season, the United Kingdom\u2019s singular focus on Brexit warped the judgment of some of its most senior officials. Even after three years of Trump assaulting the fabric of the international order that Britain had co-founded\u2014and for seven decades, defended\u2014the prospect of another four years of Trump did little to unite Johnson\u2019s team against it. Instead, his advisers were divided on the prospect of a Biden presidency. Some feared that a Biden administration would distance itself from the United Kingdom, draw closer to the European Union and especially Germany, and that Brexit would spell the end of a quick U.S.-British free trade deal. This fear appeared to outweigh concern that a second Trump term might carry grave consequences for the  fate of American democracy  or the international order.  FALLING INTO LINE One year into Biden\u2019s presidency, Johnson still has not gotten his trade deal, and unresolved questions about the future of Northern Ireland have fueled instability in British relations not just with Europe but also with the United States. Johnson\u2019s inability to resolve the uncertainty over the Irish border, moreover, has contributed to an atmosphere of mistrust between him and an Irish Catholic U.S. president who is deeply committed to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Despite these lingering areas of mistrust, however, the Johnson administration has used its new independence from Europe to align its foreign policy with that of the Biden administration. In a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2021, Johnson stressed the importance of the United Kingdom\u2019s security partnerships and announced a $22 billion increase in British defense spending over the next four years. It was welcome news in Washington but received little attention at home.  A few months later, Johnson\u2019s government published a  strategy  document that spelled out a foreign policy agenda that is closely aligned with the Biden administration\u2019s approach, emphasizing science, liberal-democratic values, and crucially, a greater strategic focus on the Indo-Pacific. The two countries are not perfectly aligned, however. The United Kingdom aims to join a transpacific trade deal that Washington has shunned, and it is already part of the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank, another regional institution that the United States chose not to join. The United Kingdom is also not part of the Quad, the United States\u2019 partnership with Australia, India, and Japan that aims to shape the future of a region increasingly dominated by China. But London and Washington took another important step toward synchronizing their objectives in Asia in September when they announced the AUKUS partnership, a trilateral security and defense partnership among Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States that will allow for greater cooperation on cyber-capabilities, artificial intelligence, and quantum technologies and enable Australia to acquire a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. By falling in line with the U.S. position on China, the United Kingdom has distinguished itself from the EU, which has been slower to demonstrate a common policy toward China or to clearly align its China policy with the United States. \u00a0  Johnson has used his new independence from Europe to align his foreign policy with that of the Biden administration. The United Kingdom has also embraced the United States\u2019 return to multilateralism, taking advantage of its presidency of the G-7 and role as co-chair of the 2021 UN Climate Summit in Glasgow to distinguish itself as an international leader in something approaching an equal partnership with the United States. Both London and Washington have also reaffirmed their commitment to protecting democracy around the world. In her speech to the Conservative Party Conference, Truss announced the United Kingdom\u2019s commitment to support a \u201cnetwork of liberty,\u201d a concept that mirrors Biden\u2019s push to aid global democracy in its contest with authoritarianism. But the veneer of equality between the two partners became harder to sustain after the United States withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021. The overwhelming feeling across the British foreign policy establishment was that the United States showed little regard for the interests of its closest European security partner in winding down a shared 20-year war. Any claim to an independent British foreign policy was dashed as Johnson was forced to go along, weathering the domestic political backlash that the chaotic withdrawal sparked at home.  Johnson\u2019s efforts to align with Washington\u2019s strategic priorities have divided opinion among Britain\u2019s foreign policy establishment, and for good reason. The United Kingdom\u2019s ability to sustain a meaningful role as a security provider in the Indo-Pacific\u2014one that is consequential enough to matter for the United States\u2014is limited, and attempting to do so risks diluting its role as the leading contributor to Euro-Atlantic security. And while AUKUS has bolstered Johnson\u2019s image of a global Britain and diverted attention away from the fallout surrounding the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the rollout of the partnership was so badly handled that it put the United Kingdom sharply at odds with France, its closest European security partner.  HARD WORK AT HOME The  shadow of Brexit  still looms over the U.S.-British relationship, but despite the mismatch between the respective occupants of the White House and 10 Downing Street, the historic partnership looks surprisingly robust. Unlike its continental European counterparts, which are talking about the need for strategic autonomy in case a Trumpist president returns to Washington, the United Kingdom has sought closer foreign policy alignment with the United States.  The United Kingdom has been too wrapped up in its own domestic politics to take the threat of internal political instability in the United States very seriously. Its foreign policy strategists, previously consumed by the imperative to define a new global role for the country, are now preoccupied with a major security crisis closer to home\u2014one that has drawn Washington\u2019s focus back to Europe. For all of these reasons, London has not dwelled on the risk that the United States might one day prove too weak at home to lead abroad or that it might radically rethink its commitment to  European security . Johnson\u2019s rapidly weakening domestic position, brought on by revelations of parties in Whitehall and Downing Street during COVID-19 lockdowns, have made it even less likely that his government will rethink its alignment with Washington. Ultimately, though, it will be hard to sustain a strong U.S.-British relationship unless both partners fix their democracies. Liberal democracy remains the best anchor for the U.S.-British partnership. Fortifying it will require bridging internal divisions, tackling inequality, ensuring the resilience of democratic institutions and civil society, and addressing the pernicious effects of disinformation, fake news, and entrenched partisan narratives. \u00a0 The United Kingdom and the United States should also celebrate their shared history of diversity and harness it to reimagine a U.S.-British partnership that symbolizes a commitment to tolerance, pluralism, and diversity. This foundation can undergird an intelligent internationalism based on shared national interests and equipped for the twenty-first century. In a world defined by intense rivalry between powerful countries that are fundamentally at odds over even the most basic values, a historic partnership between two liberal democracies should be carefully guarded.

In 2016, when still a candidate, Trump disparaged Washington\u2019s traditional allies, dismissed NATO as \u201cobsolete,\u201d and claimed that maintaining military and financial commitments in Europe and elsewhere was \u201cbankrupting\u201d the United States. This tough rhetoric continued during his administration. After his withdrawal from a host of international accords, including the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, it seemed possible that Trump would also fail to fulfill long-standing commitments to U.S. allies in Europe and East Asia. The U.S. foreign policy establishment feared that the alliances underpinning the so-called liberal international order were in jeopardy. So traumatic were these years believed to be that, on taking office, President Joe Biden, along with many in the Washington foreign policy community, rushed to reassure U.S. allies that order had been restored. \u201cAmerica is back,\u201d declared Biden in February 2021. \u201cWe must recommit to our alliances,\u201d asserted Secretary of State Antony Blinken at NATO headquarters in March. Chuck Hagel, Malcolm Rifkind, Kevin Rudd, and Ivo Daalder, two U.S. and two allied former statesmen and foreign policy elites, called for \u201ca return to fundamentals\u201d to reassure wary U.S. allies. In other words, the United States needed to undertake what Secretary of State George Shultz once called \u201cgardening\u201d: grooming allies, soothing their sensitivities, and signaling solidarity and cooperation. But those calling for Biden to carefully minister to wounded U.S. alliances misunderstood what really happened during Trump\u2019s presidency. The ostensibly great threat of Trump had little effect on Washington\u2019s major allies.  The Trump years  did not alienate traditional U.S. allies so much as it exposed their chronic weakness and their reluctance to push back against the United States. Trump\u2019s brazen and often distasteful behavior revealed a bald truth: U.S. allies will put up with more capriciousness, browbeating, and neglect than anyone expected. The U.S. alliance system is built on hierarchy, dependency, and the stubborn persistence of American power. This network benefits the United States by supporting its efforts to achieve and maintain global influence, and it benefits U.S. allies by dramatically reducing their defense costs and increasing their trade gains. As a result, these countries are willing to tolerate U.S. actions that deviate from Washington\u2019s traditional liberalism and multilateralism\u2014such as Trump\u2019s abuse and tariffs or Biden\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from Afghanistan. There was also no sign that the allies feared abandonment or sensed a major decline in the relative power of the United States. Despite the sound and fury of recent years, U.S. alliances remain quite robust. The rhetorical agonizing over the need to assuage allies is unnecessary: the United States can pressure its allies far more than anyone imagined it could. No reassurance is required. The United States\u2019 alliances\u2014whether multilateral arrangements such as NATO or bilateral agreements with states such as Japan and South Korea\u2014are strikingly unequal. Diplomatic politesse about \u201cfriendship\u201d or \u201cpartnership\u201d obscures U.S. military dominance in all these relationships. U.S. allies\u2014particularly those whose military capabilities have atrophied since the Cold War\u2014are more accurately described as junior members of a patron-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship in which the patron can be simultaneously demanding and neglectful of its prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. The substantial gulf in economic capacity and military capability between the United States and its allies pushes these associations toward hierarchy in practice, if not in form. That hierarchy, in turn, creates a dependency on U.S. power, permitting Washington to ignore militarily weak allies when it suits U.S. interests. There is little the neglected allies can do about it. States around the world join and value alliances with the United States for two reasons: they face military threats on their borders, and they want access to U.S. markets. The United States is economically and militarily strong enough to act as an importer of last resort for smaller economies and to project power to defend weaker countries. Geographically distant enough to not pose a direct military threat itself, it is the ideal state for shifting local balances of power in favor of weaker states under threat. For this reason, U.S. alliances have weathered many past storms, from seemingly endless trade disputes between Japan and the United States since the 1970s to French and German opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. U.S. allies tolerate Washington\u2019s abuse of its position of strength because, from their perspective, it is worth the cost. The benefits of a world-class security guarantee and access to the world\u2019s leading economy vastly outweigh the humiliations of Trump\u2019s browbeating or the political costs of occasionally being pressed into unwanted foreign policy ventures, such as the so-called war on terror. The alternative\u2014the massive cost of self-defense and the vulnerability of standing alone against the likes of China or Russia\u2014is worse. It is in this sense that the United States is what former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called \u201cthe indispensable nation.\u201d But this indispensability does not derive from the country\u2019s adherence to democratic values or liberal norms. Instead, it comes from American power and the benefits gained from aligning with that power. That blunt reality compels a reconsideration of the supposed crisis of the Trump years, when much of the foreign policy establishment feared that the White House was doing untold damage to U.S. alliances. Analysts may have fretted about Trump\u2019s bullying and bristling antagonism, but the allies targeted did not seem hugely bothered. Their actual behavior during the Trump presidency did not suggest any attempt to defect from, hedge against, or drift away from the patronage of the United States. Trump antagonized allies everywhere, but the examples of four core treaty allies\u2014Germany, France, Japan, and South Korea\u2014in the crucial theaters of Europe and East Asia are especially telling. Many analysts now continue to urge Biden to reassure these U.S. allies of Washington\u2019s steadfast commitment, but it is hard to see the need. By the logic of those urging reassurance, Trump\u2019s behavior should have pushed these countries away from the United States politically or strategically. But that was not the case. None of them tried to distance itself from the United States to protect itself from Trump\u2019s unpredictability. To the contrary, they all flattered Trump. They tolerated his antics and did not risk expulsion from under the U.S. security umbrella. The Trump years have turned the conventional wisdom on its head: Washington has considerable room to neglect its allies without incurring reprisals. Germany is arguably the United States\u2019 most important partner in Europe, home to more U.S. troops and military infrastructure than any other U.S. ally. And naturally, Trump went out of his way to antagonize the country and its then chancellor, Angela Merkel. Trump deeply disliked Merkel, speaking of her pejoratively in private remarks that were leaked. He complained on Twitter that  Germany  owed a \u201cfee\u201d to NATO, allegedly handed Merkel a made-up bill for back pay owed to NATO, and proposed withdrawing U.S. troops from Germany. He left the U.S. ambassadorship to Germany open for much of his term and then selected an intentionally polarizing figure, the commentator and right-wing Internet firebrand Richard Grenell, who hectored the German foreign policy establishment and promoted Trumpian populists throughout Europe. In short, Trump provided adequate cause for German elites to rethink their country\u2019s relationship with the United States. Indeed, Merkel warned as early as 2017 that Europe could \u201cno longer rely on allies\u201d and that \u201cEurope must really take our fate into our own hands.\u201d But Germany did precious little to end its reliance on the United States or take Europe\u2019s fate into its own hands. Germany did not, for example, seek a serious side deal or separate agreement with NATO\u2019s primary opponent, Russia. (The chancellor had already agreed with Russia to the creation of a controversial oil pipeline running from Russia to Germany\u2014Nord Stream 2\u2014before Trump came into office.) Merkel supported the 2018 renewal of sanctions against Russia over its meddling in Ukraine, and she routinely criticized Russia for its repression of internal dissent. The Trump years did not see any improvement in the tense, if businesslike, German-Russian relationship, much less a German turn against the United States. U.S. troops in Wiesbaden, Germany, February 2022   U.S. Army / Reuters   Bullied by Washington, Berlin could have chosen to strengthen Europe as a political and military counterweight to the United States. Proponents of a stronger Europe have long talked about bulking up EU institutions, for instance, a move that would allow the continent to act more independently on the world stage. But institutional reform in Europe was at a standstill during the Trump years, and it remains so. Similarly, EU hawks have argued for decades for a stronger European defense program. Merkel herself seemed to embrace the notion of a more independent and capable European military after her first meeting with Trump. Germany, as the continent\u2019s largest economy, would have to play an essential role in developing an integrated European military. But the Germans were indecisive, and nothing came of these rumblings. As in the years before Trump, there is still no European military or unified command, no sharing of large platforms such as aircraft carriers, much less weapons of mass destruction, and no joint strategic doctrine. Defense spending is an obvious area where more resources could have strengthened Berlin\u2019s hand when facing Washington. But Merkel declined to invest more in her country\u2019s military during the Trump years. As a percentage of GDP, German defense spending stood at 1.15 percent in 2017, 1.17 percent in 2018, and 1.28 percent in 2019. In terms of military strategy, meanwhile, German officials made no effort to separate from the Americans. The closest thing Germany has to a formal grand strategy is presented in an irregularly updated white paper on national security. The most recent dates from 2016, a revealing date in and of itself: Trump\u2019s rhetoric and the resulting indignant talk of European self-reliance did not prompt German officials to update their formal strategy. France was the U.S. ally most likely to respond to Trump with meaningful policy shifts. Under former President Charles de Gaulle, France partially withdrew from NATO in the 1960s. It pursued a somewhat independent foreign policy during the Cold War and has long explicitly promoted the notion of a stronger pan-European defense posture as a counterweight to the United States. True to form, Trump sought to dominate and embarrass French President Emmanuel Macron. During a 2017 visit to Paris, Trump forced Macron into a bizarre, 29-second white-knuckle handshake. The next year, he showily brushed dandruff off Macron\u2019s suit in front of the media at the White House. As he did with Merkel, Trump often slid gleefully into a war of words with Macron. After a 2018 spat over nationalism, Trump tweeted, \u201cEmmanuel suffers from a very low approval rating,\u201d and then, peevishly, \u201cMake France Great Again!\u201d After Macron criticized Trump\u2019s disdain for NATO at the alliance\u2019s summit in 2019, Trump struck back, calling Macron \u201cnasty, insulting, and disrespectful.\u201d Given France\u2019s history of an independent foreign policy, here was an opportunity to reorient the country\u2019s relationship with the United States. But Macron, like Merkel, sought to appease and flatter Trump. Macron himself admitted in 2018, \u201cOur relationship with the United States is absolutely critical. Fundamental. We need it.\u201d Macron\u2019s behavior during the Trump years revealed just how dependent France was. Unhappy with Trump\u2019s abuse, France might have pursued separate deals with Russia, the traditional opponent of the Western alliance. But the French made no such effort to go around the United States or any attempt to emulate de Gaulle\u2019s partial defection from the alliance. As did Germany\u2019s, France\u2019s relationship with Russia remained measured and did not noticeably improve. France continued to support the regular renewal of sanctions against Russia after its annexation of Crimea in 2014. France, like Germany, cleaved to the antagonistic NATO line on Russia. France also did not forcefully seek a European military arrangement as a substitute for a U.S.-based alliance. The French government did make at least rhetorical gestures toward greater military integration among European allies. For years, Macron has variously called for European defense autonomy, an EU army, an end to European dependence on U.S. arms, and so on. But this posturing merely borrowed from the familiar stable of French Europeanist rhetoric. European military initiatives, such as the Eurocorps, a small, mostly symbolic force of just 1,000 soldiers, or the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force, a small Anglo-French rapid-reaction force, remain embryonic. EU member states are no closer to forming large multinational military units or sharing heavy weapons platforms. Competition between France and Germany also makes this regional consolidation harder. Germany still suspects that France\u2019s vision of continental unity actually means yoking German economic power to French foreign policy ambitions. France\u2019s defense spending as a percentage of its GDP is higher than Germany\u2019s. But like German spending, French spending did not tick upward in the Trump era. In 2017, France spent 1.91 percent; in 2018, 1.85 percent; and in 2019, 1.86 percent. These sums are not enough to buttress an EU army or make a more audacious bid for Gaullist independence. Nor did France revise its strategic approach to the United States. France\u2019s primary grand strategy statement is its 2017 Defense and National Security Strategic Review, complemented by the shorter 2021 Strategic Update. The 2017 document emphasizes traditional French themes about strategic autonomy (from the Americans) and Macron\u2019s particular interest in having France lead a European defense posture. The 2021 update renounces a breach with the United States, mentioning Trump only once in passing commentary about \u201cmistrust\u201d and his \u201ctransactional approach.\u201d Even the Biden administration\u2019s decision to pursue the so-called AUKUS agreement in 2021, which led Australia to cancel a submarine contract with France in favor of having the submarines produced by the United States, induced only a short-lived diplomatic row between France and the United States, before Macron and Biden announced that they were putting the matter behind them. If anything, the incident revealed France\u2019s appreciation of the mood of the U.S. foreign policy establishment. Paris seemed to be stirring up a dispute to get attention from Washington precisely because it recognized U.S. fears about antsy allies and knew that it could exploit them. Trump did not alarm the United States\u2019 Asian allies as much as he did its European ones. Analysts in East Asia did not fret about the collapse of the liberal international order as much as their counterparts in Europe and in the Washington foreign policy community did. The leaders of  Japan  and South Korea both vigorously flattered Trump. As a British journalist in Japan put it, \u201cThe Japanese saw Trump as just another loud American.\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe massaged Trump\u2019s ego. Abe repeatedly took Trump golfing, his favorite sport. They took selfies on the green, and Abe even gave Trump a gold-plated driver. He brought Trump to a dinner with the Japanese emperor. Abe\u2019s most obsequious gift was a baseball hat embroidered with the words \u201cDonald & Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.\u201d Still, Trump\u2019s rhetoric on Japan was provocative. Although he avoided personal attacks on Abe, Trump decried, as he often did in regard to other countries as well, trade imbalances with Japan; threatened enormous tariffs on Japanese automotive exports; and complained about the scale of U.S. defense contributions to Japan. He also publicly disagreed with Abe on the severity of the North Korean missile threat in 2019 and, with his usual brusque tone, inveighed against Japanese pacifism. \u201cIf Japan is attacked, we will fight World War III,\u201d he said on Fox News. \u201cBut if we\u2019re attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us at all. They can watch it on a Sony television.\u201d Trump and Abe in Tokyo, November 2017   Frank Robichon / Reuters   In the face of all these insults, Japan, like Germany and France, bent to accommodate Trump. Tokyo did not strike substantive side deals with any local opponents, most obviously China but also North Korea and Russia. Trumpian demands for concessions might have pushed Japan to resolve its disputes with these countries\u2014including wrangles with North Korea over the fate of abducted Japanese people and with Russia over the ownership of the Kuril Islands. But Japan did nothing of the sort. Nor did it make many lateral moves to strengthen ties with other U.S. prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. The most obvious target of such an effort would have been nearby South Korea. Instead, Japanese\u2013South Korean relations deteriorated during the Trump years, as the United States stopped bothering to calm tensions between the two over Japan\u2019s past imperial behavior in Korea. Since Biden became president, Japan has aligned somewhat more closely with Taiwan, Australia, and India, but only under the aegis of U.S. regional leadership. As Biden has pushed back against China over Taiwan, Japan has followed suit. Tokyo has reached out to Canberra and New Delhi within the rubric of the U.S.-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad. Japan did make an effort to save a Pacific-area trade deal\u2014the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2014from which Trump withdrew. But the replacement deal, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, was an economic move to expand trade ties, not an effort to contest U.S. security leadership in East Asia. Defense spending was an area in which Japan had room to grow. Before Trump, Tokyo spent less than one percent of GDP on defense, an astonishingly low figure for a state adjacent to China and with great-power pretensions. But Trump\u2019s demands changed nothing. Japanese spending on defense barely budged during his presidency, staying stuck at around 0.9 percent of GDP. Japan relied on U.S. guarantees while mollifying Trump with flattering gifts. At the level of strategic doctrine, Japan made no changes in the Trump period. Its current National Security Strategy dates to 2013 but is still in force. A short write-up of the strategy by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2016 lists its second objective as \u201cstrengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance.\u201d None of the three other U.S. allies\u2019 national security strategies, not Germany\u2019s, or France\u2019s, or South Korea\u2019s, prioritizes the U.S. alliance as centrally as Japan\u2019s doctrine does. All of Trump\u2019s bellicosity and sharp elbows did not affect Japanese policy choices or defense spending. Japan chose to ride the tiger instead. Of all the major U.S. allies, Trump seemed to harbor special disdain for South Korea. In 2020, he allegedly told a meeting of U.S. governors that South Koreans were \u201cterrible people.\u201d As with other allies, he complained regularly about the United States\u2019 trade deficit with South Korea and the costs of U.S. military support for the country. He repeatedly gestured toward pulling U.S. troops out, and observers feared that, if reelected in 2020, he would actually try to do so. Trump personally intervened in U.S.\u2013South Korean cost-sharing negotiations, demanding that Seoul raise its $1 billion contribution to $5 billion. Trump also ordered a revision of the U.S.\u2013Korea Free Trade Agreement, signed during the George W. Bush administration, even as he hinted that U.S. car and steel tariffs would carry on regardless. He even called South Korean President Moon Jae-in an \u201cappeaser\u201d of  North Korea  in 2017 and repeatedly said he did not like dealing with Moon, while making clear his preference for the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, with whom he supposedly \u201cfell in love.\u201d But like the other allies, South Korea was largely unaffected. Moon and his first foreign minister waxed lyrical about Trump\u2019s \u201ccourage,\u201d \u201cdetermination,\u201d and \u201cleadership.\u201d After publicly warning Trump in 2017 not to attack North Korea, Moon pivoted to flattery, even floating the idea that Trump would merit a Nobel Peace Prize should he meet with Kim. The blatant pandering and lack of seriousness of this suggestion was an open secret in South Korea. South Korean behavior supported this assertion. Despite Trump\u2019s contempt\u2014and Moon\u2019s left-wing politics with its tradition of anti-Americanism\u2014the relationship between Seoul and Washington remained much as it was before. During the Trump presidency, South Korea made no changes to its otherwise businesslike relationship with Russia, and its relations with China remained fraught. Regarding North Korea, Moon did not make a breakthrough, despite a vigorous effort to reach a d\u00e9tente. South Korea could have responded to Trump\u2019s disdain by trying to bury the hatchet with Japan and strengthen its ties with the other major democratic power of the region. After all, both countries\u2019 fear of abandonment by the United States under Trump created room for rapprochement. Instead, the opposite happened. Moon doubled down on the traditional anti-Japanese line of the South Korean left, provoking a small crisis with the United States in 2019 when he resisted an intelligence-sharing deal with Japan. In the face of Trump\u2019s derision, South Korea could have strengthened its hand by increasing its defense spending. It did so\u2014but only slightly, and as part of long-term military modernization efforts planned well before Trump came to office. At the strategic level, South Korea remained\u2014and remains\u2014yoked to the U.S. military presence on the peninsula. The most important marker of this integration is that operational wartime control of the South Korean military has yet to return to the South Korean government even after 20 years of discussion. Should war break out with North Korea, a U.S. general would still command the South Korean army in the field. The U.S. military forces on the peninsula also remain deeply integrated with the South Korean military, and the tempo of joint training exercises has picked up since Trump left office. South Korea last published a national security strategy in 2018. It emphasized outreach to North Korea but, critically, did not frame such overtures as a substitute for the alliance with the United States. South Korea had good reason to drift away from the United States. Trump repeatedly publicly condemned it, and it is governed by a coalition with roots in anti-American protest. But it did not. Like the actions of the other allies, Seoul\u2019s approach was to flatter and persevere, not bolt. Each of these four allies chose to tolerate Trump\u2019s abuse rather than distance itself from Washington. This choice was a reflection not of Trump\u2019s persona or acumen but of the reality of U.S. power. However humiliating, accommodating Trump was cheaper than the potential costs of distancing themselves from the United States. Perhaps U.S. allies restrained themselves. They might have seen Trump as a bizarre, one-off outcome of the unusual U.S. presidential election system, and so they politely chose to bite their tongues. Had Trump been reelected, the allies might then have shifted to more independent foreign policies. But that seems unlikely. These allies had faced the erratic consequences of the U.S. presidential election system just a little more than a decade before. President George\u00a0W. Bush was maligned as a unilateralist cowboy who led a hyperpower into an aggressive, unnecessary war. But when Bush was reelected in 2004, nothing happened. Then as now, the structures of the U.S. alliance system stayed intact, and the core European and Asian prot\u00e9g\u00e9s remained committed to their U.S. patron. Trump may have raised the hackles of the U.S.  foreign policy  establishment more than he alarmed the governments of allied countries. But even if Berlin, Paris, Tokyo, or Seoul was so perturbed by Trump that it felt compelled to do something, its options were limited and costly. Would it suddenly pursue an independent foreign policy at great expense in the face of Chinese and Russian power? These allied governments and the strategy documents they produced never seriously considered alternatives to an alliance with the United States, even under a possible second Trump term, because those choices were all too costly. Trump and Macron in Biarritz, France, August 2019   Carlos Barria / Reuters   The costs of delinking from the U.S. military, for instance, would be high. Germany, France, and Japan spend less than two percent of their GDPs on their militaries and are decidedly uninterested in matching the U.S. figure of over three percent. Worse, most U.S. allies are now tacitly dependent on the United States for the logistical and administrative depth required by modern combat operations, as illustrated by France and the United Kingdom\u2019s dependence on U.S. logistics in the 2011 intervention in Libya and Japan\u2019s and South Korea\u2019s dependence on the U.S. Navy to participate in antipiracy actions in the Indian Ocean. Any attempt to meaningfully hedge against the United States would require substantial spending increases, massive expansions of recruitment (including the expansion of conscription in South Korea), and other costly moves that might rankle taxpayers and voters. Erstwhile allies would also risk the economic ramifications of falling afoul of the United States. Access to the world\u2019s largest open market is crucial for their growth, particularly for export-driven, mercantilist economies such as Japan and South Korea. Trump made clear his willingness to leverage allies\u2019 trade dependence and target allies with tariffs. But perhaps the most powerful factor keeping the allies bound to the United States is the reality that they don\u2019t really have anywhere else to turn. For democracies, a certain scorn for allying with dictatorships is natural, and options such as rapprochement with China or Russia or an inter-Korean federation have obvious political risks. The persistence of the animosity between Japan and South Korea and of the competitive rivalry between France and Germany would complicate efforts by these powers to band together on their own. Humiliation by Trump was a small price to pay in the absence of better options. The U.S. alliance system is predicated on hierarchy and dependency. Trump\u2019s treatment of U.S. allies was boorish and unnecessarily hostile, likely driven by egotistical cravings for status and masculine domination. A general contempt for his behavior is appropriate, but that behavior also illuminated, however harshly, two long-standing truths about U.S. alliances. These relationships are deeply unequal. This point is frequently obscured by U.S. rhetoric about solidarity and standing \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with allies. Such language masks fundamental power imbalances and the fact that U.S. alliances ultimately rest on an alignment of interests. As the political scientists Patrick Porter and Joshua Shifrinson have argued, the American predilection for calling allies \u201cfriends\u201d breeds false expectations and encourages allies with underpowered militaries to assume Washington will tolerate their piggybacking on U.S. defense guarantees. Because of their shared liberal values, U.S. allies are also inclined to believe that the United States will solicit and respect their opinions. But these allies then complain of bullying when U.S. indifference to their viewpoints lays bare the fundamental asymmetries of their relationships with the United States, as happened under Trump and as happened again last summer when Biden withdrew from Afghanistan while ignoring NATO allies\u2019 objections. To remedy this, U.S. allies should address the root causes of Washington\u2019s ability to ride roughshod over them: their low defense spending and their consequent weak power projection capabilities. The Trump years also underlined the fact that the U.S. alliance system is not in decline. A wider liberal international order\u2014reliant on reasonably liberal behavior from nondemocracies, especially China, in a rule-bound trading network\u2014may indeed be eroding. But the more limited, patron-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 arrangement between the United States and its core allies in Europe and Asia appears stable. U.S. allies still want this structure. Ideally, the United States would behave solicitously toward and cooperatively with its allies. Trump\u2019s crude belligerence was both reprehensible and, in practical terms, pointless. But the record of the Trump period strongly suggests that, although desirable, it is not necessary for the United States to be diplomatic in its relations with its allies. U.S. alliances are asymmetric and are becoming more so as the power projection capabilities of the junior partners atrophy. The United States has a lot of unused leverage to push its allies even harder. It can neglect them without reprisal, even if many commentators do not think it should. Trump produced a clarifying moment; for a few years, he starkly revealed that U.S. allies have a high threshold for mistreatment and bullying. Attestations of American decline, which would likely entail the defection of U.S. allies to other patrons, are exaggerated. This realization should allow the Biden administration to demand more from U.S. allies than most administrations have asked for in the past, particularly in the realm of defense spending. The United States can at times bully its allies because they rely on American power. The politesse of reassurance may be desirable and decorous, but U.S. allies are not about to abandon their patron.

In 2016, when still a candidate, Trump disparaged Washington\u2019s traditional allies, dismissed NATO as \u201cobsolete,\u201d and claimed that maintaining military and financial commitments in Europe and elsewhere was \u201cbankrupting\u201d the United States. This tough rhetoric continued during his administration. After his withdrawal from a host of international accords, including the Paris climate agreement and the Iran nuclear deal, it seemed possible that Trump would also fail to fulfill long-standing commitments to U.S. allies in Europe and East Asia. The U.S. foreign policy establishment feared that the alliances underpinning the so-called liberal international order were in jeopardy.@@So traumatic were these years believed to be that, on taking office, President Joe Biden, along with many in the Washington foreign policy community, rushed to reassure U.S. allies that order had been restored. \u201cAmerica is back,\u201d declared Biden in February 2021. \u201cWe must recommit to our alliances,\u201d asserted Secretary of State Antony Blinken at NATO headquarters in March. Chuck Hagel, Malcolm Rifkind, Kevin Rudd, and Ivo Daalder, two U.S. and two allied former statesmen and foreign policy elites, called for \u201ca return to fundamentals\u201d to reassure wary U.S. allies. In other words, the United States needed to undertake what Secretary of State George Shultz once called \u201cgardening\u201d: grooming allies, soothing their sensitivities, and signaling solidarity and cooperation.@@But those calling for Biden to carefully minister to wounded U.S. alliances misunderstood what really happened during Trump\u2019s presidency. The ostensibly great threat of Trump had little effect on Washington\u2019s major allies. @@ did not alienate traditional U.S. allies so much as it exposed their chronic weakness and their reluctance to push back against the United States. Trump\u2019s brazen and often distasteful behavior revealed a bald truth: U.S. allies will put up with more capriciousness, browbeating, and neglect than anyone expected.@@The U.S. alliance system is built on hierarchy, dependency, and the stubborn persistence of American power. This network benefits the United States by supporting its efforts to achieve and maintain global influence, and it benefits U.S. allies by dramatically reducing their defense costs and increasing their trade gains. As a result, these countries are willing to tolerate U.S. actions that deviate from Washington\u2019s traditional liberalism and multilateralism\u2014such as Trump\u2019s abuse and tariffs or Biden\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from Afghanistan. There was also no sign that the allies feared abandonment or sensed a major decline in the relative power of the United States. Despite the sound and fury of recent years, U.S. alliances remain quite robust. The rhetorical agonizing over the need to assuage allies is unnecessary: the United States can pressure its allies far more than anyone imagined it could. No reassurance is required.@@The United States\u2019 alliances\u2014whether multilateral arrangements such as NATO or bilateral agreements with states such as Japan and South Korea\u2014are strikingly unequal. Diplomatic politesse about \u201cfriendship\u201d or \u201cpartnership\u201d obscures U.S. military dominance in all these relationships. U.S. allies\u2014particularly those whose military capabilities have atrophied since the Cold War\u2014are more accurately described as junior members of a patron-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 relationship in which the patron can be simultaneously demanding and neglectful of its prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. The substantial gulf in economic capacity and military capability between the United States and its allies pushes these associations toward hierarchy in practice, if not in form. That hierarchy, in turn, creates a dependency on U.S. power, permitting Washington to ignore militarily weak allies when it suits U.S. interests. There is little the neglected allies can do about it.@@States around the world join and value alliances with the United States for two reasons: they face military threats on their borders, and they want access to U.S. markets. The United States is economically and militarily strong enough to act as an importer of last resort for smaller economies and to project power to defend weaker countries. Geographically distant enough to not pose a direct military threat itself, it is the ideal state for shifting local balances of power in favor of weaker states under threat.@@For this reason, U.S. alliances have weathered many past storms, from seemingly endless trade disputes between Japan and the United States since the 1970s to French and German opposition to the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. U.S. allies tolerate Washington\u2019s abuse of its position of strength because, from their perspective, it is worth the cost. The benefits of a world-class security guarantee and access to the world\u2019s leading economy vastly outweigh the humiliations of Trump\u2019s browbeating or the political costs of occasionally being pressed into unwanted foreign policy ventures, such as the so-called war on terror. The alternative\u2014the massive cost of self-defense and the vulnerability of standing alone against the likes of China or Russia\u2014is worse. It is in this sense that the United States is what former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called \u201cthe indispensable nation.\u201d But this indispensability does not derive from the country\u2019s adherence to democratic values or liberal norms. Instead, it comes from American power and the benefits gained from aligning with that power.@@That blunt reality compels a reconsideration of the supposed crisis of the Trump years, when much of the foreign policy establishment feared that the White House was doing untold damage to U.S. alliances. Analysts may have fretted about Trump\u2019s bullying and bristling antagonism, but the allies targeted did not seem hugely bothered. Their actual behavior during the Trump presidency did not suggest any attempt to defect from, hedge against, or drift away from the patronage of the United States.@@Trump antagonized allies everywhere, but the examples of four core treaty allies\u2014Germany, France, Japan, and South Korea\u2014in the crucial theaters of Europe and East Asia are especially telling. Many analysts now continue to urge Biden to reassure these U.S. allies of Washington\u2019s steadfast commitment, but it is hard to see the need. By the logic of those urging reassurance, Trump\u2019s behavior should have pushed these countries away from the United States politically or strategically. But that was not the case. None of them tried to distance itself from the United States to protect itself from Trump\u2019s unpredictability. To the contrary, they all flattered Trump. They tolerated his antics and did not risk expulsion from under the U.S. security umbrella. The Trump years have turned the conventional wisdom on its head: Washington has considerable room to neglect its allies without incurring reprisals.@@Germany is arguably the United States\u2019 most important partner in Europe, home to more U.S. troops and military infrastructure than any other U.S. ally. And naturally, Trump went out of his way to antagonize the country and its then chancellor, Angela Merkel.@@Trump deeply disliked Merkel, speaking of her pejoratively in private remarks that were leaked. He complained on Twitter that @@ owed a \u201cfee\u201d to NATO, allegedly handed Merkel a made-up bill for back pay owed to NATO, and proposed withdrawing U.S. troops from Germany. He left the U.S. ambassadorship to Germany open for much of his term and then selected an intentionally polarizing figure, the commentator and right-wing Internet firebrand Richard Grenell, who hectored the German foreign policy establishment and promoted Trumpian populists throughout Europe. In short, Trump provided adequate cause for German elites to rethink their country\u2019s relationship with the United States. Indeed, Merkel warned as early as 2017 that Europe could \u201cno longer rely on allies\u201d and that \u201cEurope must really take our fate into our own hands.\u201d@@But Germany did precious little to end its reliance on the United States or take Europe\u2019s fate into its own hands. Germany did not, for example, seek a serious side deal or separate agreement with NATO\u2019s primary opponent, Russia. (The chancellor had already agreed with Russia to the creation of a controversial oil pipeline running from Russia to Germany\u2014Nord Stream 2\u2014before Trump came into office.) Merkel supported the 2018 renewal of sanctions against Russia over its meddling in Ukraine, and she routinely criticized Russia for its repression of internal dissent. The Trump years did not see any improvement in the tense, if businesslike, German-Russian relationship, much less a German turn against the United States.@@Bullied by Washington, Berlin could have chosen to strengthen Europe as a political and military counterweight to the United States. Proponents of a stronger Europe have long talked about bulking up EU institutions, for instance, a move that would allow the continent to act more independently on the world stage. But institutional reform in Europe was at a standstill during the Trump years, and it remains so. Similarly, EU hawks have argued for decades for a stronger European defense program. Merkel herself seemed to embrace the notion of a more independent and capable European military after her first meeting with Trump. Germany, as the continent\u2019s largest economy, would have to play an essential role in developing an integrated European military. But the Germans were indecisive, and nothing came of these rumblings. As in the years before Trump, there is still no European military or unified command, no sharing of large platforms such as aircraft carriers, much less weapons of mass destruction, and no joint strategic doctrine.@@Defense spending is an obvious area where more resources could have strengthened Berlin\u2019s hand when facing Washington. But Merkel declined to invest more in her country\u2019s military during the Trump years. As a percentage of GDP, German defense spending stood at 1.15 percent in 2017, 1.17 percent in 2018, and 1.28 percent in 2019. In terms of military strategy, meanwhile, German officials made no effort to separate from the Americans. The closest thing Germany has to a formal grand strategy is presented in an irregularly updated white paper on national security. The most recent dates from 2016, a revealing date in and of itself: Trump\u2019s rhetoric and the resulting indignant talk of European self-reliance did not prompt German officials to update their formal strategy.@@France was the U.S. ally most likely to respond to Trump with meaningful policy shifts. Under former President Charles de Gaulle, France partially withdrew from NATO in the 1960s. It pursued a somewhat independent foreign policy during the Cold War and has long explicitly promoted the notion of a stronger pan-European defense posture as a counterweight to the United States.@@True to form, Trump sought to dominate and embarrass French President Emmanuel Macron. During a 2017 visit to Paris, Trump forced Macron into a bizarre, 29-second white-knuckle handshake. The next year, he showily brushed dandruff off Macron\u2019s suit in front of the media at the White House. As he did with Merkel, Trump often slid gleefully into a war of words with Macron. After a 2018 spat over nationalism, Trump tweeted, \u201cEmmanuel suffers from a very low approval rating,\u201d and then, peevishly, \u201cMake France Great Again!\u201d After Macron criticized Trump\u2019s disdain for NATO at the alliance\u2019s summit in 2019, Trump struck back, calling Macron \u201cnasty, insulting, and disrespectful.\u201d@@Given France\u2019s history of an independent foreign policy, here was an opportunity to reorient the country\u2019s relationship with the United States. But Macron, like Merkel, sought to appease and flatter Trump. Macron himself admitted in 2018, \u201cOur relationship with the United States is absolutely critical. Fundamental. We need it.\u201d@@Macron\u2019s behavior during the Trump years revealed just how dependent France was. Unhappy with Trump\u2019s abuse, France might have pursued separate deals with Russia, the traditional opponent of the Western alliance. But the French made no such effort to go around the United States or any attempt to emulate de Gaulle\u2019s partial defection from the alliance. As did Germany\u2019s, France\u2019s relationship with Russia remained measured and did not noticeably improve. France continued to support the regular renewal of sanctions against Russia after its annexation of Crimea in 2014. France, like Germany, cleaved to the antagonistic NATO line on Russia.@@France also did not forcefully seek a European military arrangement as a substitute for a U.S.-based alliance. The French government did make at least rhetorical gestures toward greater military integration among European allies. For years, Macron has variously called for European defense autonomy, an EU army, an end to European dependence on U.S. arms, and so on. But this posturing merely borrowed from the familiar stable of French Europeanist rhetoric. European military initiatives, such as the Eurocorps, a small, mostly symbolic force of just 1,000 soldiers, or the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force, a small Anglo-French rapid-reaction force, remain embryonic. EU member states are no closer to forming large multinational military units or sharing heavy weapons platforms. Competition between France and Germany also makes this regional consolidation harder. Germany still suspects that France\u2019s vision of continental unity actually means yoking German economic power to French foreign policy ambitions.@@France\u2019s defense spending as a percentage of its GDP is higher than Germany\u2019s. But like German spending, French spending did not tick upward in the Trump era. In 2017, France spent 1.91 percent; in 2018, 1.85 percent; and in 2019, 1.86 percent. These sums are not enough to buttress an EU army or make a more audacious bid for Gaullist independence.@@Nor did France revise its strategic approach to the United States. France\u2019s primary grand strategy statement is its 2017 Defense and National Security Strategic Review, complemented by the shorter 2021 Strategic Update. The 2017 document emphasizes traditional French themes about strategic autonomy (from the Americans) and Macron\u2019s particular interest in having France lead a European defense posture. The 2021 update renounces a breach with the United States, mentioning Trump only once in passing commentary about \u201cmistrust\u201d and his \u201ctransactional approach.\u201d Even the Biden administration\u2019s decision to pursue the so-called AUKUS agreement in 2021, which led Australia to cancel a submarine contract with France in favor of having the submarines produced by the United States, induced only a short-lived diplomatic row between France and the United States, before Macron and Biden announced that they were putting the matter behind them. If anything, the incident revealed France\u2019s appreciation of the mood of the U.S. foreign policy establishment. Paris seemed to be stirring up a dispute to get attention from Washington precisely because it recognized U.S. fears about antsy allies and knew that it could exploit them.@@Trump did not alarm the United States\u2019 Asian allies as much as he did its European ones. Analysts in East Asia did not fret about the collapse of the liberal international order as much as their counterparts in Europe and in the Washington foreign policy community did. The leaders of @@ and South Korea both vigorously flattered Trump. As a British journalist in Japan put it, \u201cThe Japanese saw Trump as just another loud American.\u201d@@Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe massaged Trump\u2019s ego. Abe repeatedly took Trump golfing, his favorite sport. They took selfies on the green, and Abe even gave Trump a gold-plated driver. He brought Trump to a dinner with the Japanese emperor. Abe\u2019s most obsequious gift was a baseball hat embroidered with the words \u201cDonald & Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater.\u201d@@Still, Trump\u2019s rhetoric on Japan was provocative. Although he avoided personal attacks on Abe, Trump decried, as he often did in regard to other countries as well, trade imbalances with Japan; threatened enormous tariffs on Japanese automotive exports; and complained about the scale of U.S. defense contributions to Japan. He also publicly disagreed with Abe on the severity of the North Korean missile threat in 2019 and, with his usual brusque tone, inveighed against Japanese pacifism. \u201cIf Japan is attacked, we will fight World War III,\u201d he said on Fox News. \u201cBut if we\u2019re attacked, Japan doesn\u2019t have to help us at all. They can watch it on a Sony television.\u201d@@In the face of all these insults, Japan, like Germany and France, bent to accommodate Trump. Tokyo did not strike substantive side deals with any local opponents, most obviously China but also North Korea and Russia. Trumpian demands for concessions might have pushed Japan to resolve its disputes with these countries\u2014including wrangles with North Korea over the fate of abducted Japanese people and with Russia over the ownership of the Kuril Islands. But Japan did nothing of the sort.@@Nor did it make many lateral moves to strengthen ties with other U.S. prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. The most obvious target of such an effort would have been nearby South Korea. Instead, Japanese\u2013South Korean relations deteriorated during the Trump years, as the United States stopped bothering to calm tensions between the two over Japan\u2019s past imperial behavior in Korea. Since Biden became president, Japan has aligned somewhat more closely with Taiwan, Australia, and India, but only under the aegis of U.S. regional leadership. As Biden has pushed back against China over Taiwan, Japan has followed suit. Tokyo has reached out to Canberra and New Delhi within the rubric of the U.S.-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad. Japan did make an effort to save a Pacific-area trade deal\u2014the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2014from which Trump withdrew. But the replacement deal, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, was an economic move to expand trade ties, not an effort to contest U.S. security leadership in East Asia.@@Defense spending was an area in which Japan had room to grow. Before Trump, Tokyo spent less than one percent of GDP on defense, an astonishingly low figure for a state adjacent to China and with great-power pretensions. But Trump\u2019s demands changed nothing. Japanese spending on defense barely budged during his presidency, staying stuck at around 0.9 percent of GDP. Japan relied on U.S. guarantees while mollifying Trump with flattering gifts.@@At the level of strategic doctrine, Japan made no changes in the Trump period. Its current National Security Strategy dates to 2013 but is still in force. A short write-up of the strategy by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2016 lists its second objective as \u201cstrengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance.\u201d None of the three other U.S. allies\u2019 national security strategies, not Germany\u2019s, or France\u2019s, or South Korea\u2019s, prioritizes the U.S. alliance as centrally as Japan\u2019s doctrine does. All of Trump\u2019s bellicosity and sharp elbows did not affect Japanese policy choices or defense spending. Japan chose to ride the tiger instead.@@Of all the major U.S. allies, Trump seemed to harbor special disdain for South Korea. In 2020, he allegedly told a meeting of U.S. governors that South Koreans were \u201cterrible people.\u201d As with other allies, he complained regularly about the United States\u2019 trade deficit with South Korea and the costs of U.S. military support for the country. He repeatedly gestured toward pulling U.S. troops out, and observers feared that, if reelected in 2020, he would actually try to do so. Trump personally intervened in U.S.\u2013South Korean cost-sharing negotiations, demanding that Seoul raise its $1 billion contribution to $5 billion. Trump also ordered a revision of the U.S.\u2013Korea Free Trade Agreement, signed during the George W. Bush administration, even as he hinted that U.S. car and steel tariffs would carry on regardless. He even called South Korean President Moon Jae-in an \u201cappeaser\u201d of @@ in 2017 and repeatedly said he did not like dealing with Moon, while making clear his preference for the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, with whom he supposedly \u201cfell in love.\u201d@@But like the other allies, South Korea was largely unaffected. Moon and his first foreign minister waxed lyrical about Trump\u2019s \u201ccourage,\u201d \u201cdetermination,\u201d and \u201cleadership.\u201d After publicly warning Trump in 2017 not to attack North Korea, Moon pivoted to flattery, even floating the idea that Trump would merit a Nobel Peace Prize should he meet with Kim. The blatant pandering and lack of seriousness of this suggestion was an open secret in South Korea.@@South Korean behavior supported this assertion. Despite Trump\u2019s contempt\u2014and Moon\u2019s left-wing politics with its tradition of anti-Americanism\u2014the relationship between Seoul and Washington remained much as it was before. During the Trump presidency, South Korea made no changes to its otherwise businesslike relationship with Russia, and its relations with China remained fraught. Regarding North Korea, Moon did not make a breakthrough, despite a vigorous effort to reach a d\u00e9tente.@@South Korea could have responded to Trump\u2019s disdain by trying to bury the hatchet with Japan and strengthen its ties with the other major democratic power of the region. After all, both countries\u2019 fear of abandonment by the United States under Trump created room for rapprochement. Instead, the opposite happened. Moon doubled down on the traditional anti-Japanese line of the South Korean left, provoking a small crisis with the United States in 2019 when he resisted an intelligence-sharing deal with Japan. In the face of Trump\u2019s derision, South Korea could have strengthened its hand by increasing its defense spending. It did so\u2014but only slightly, and as part of long-term military modernization efforts planned well before Trump came to office.@@At the strategic level, South Korea remained\u2014and remains\u2014yoked to the U.S. military presence on the peninsula. The most important marker of this integration is that operational wartime control of the South Korean military has yet to return to the South Korean government even after 20 years of discussion. Should war break out with North Korea, a U.S. general would still command the South Korean army in the field. The U.S. military forces on the peninsula also remain deeply integrated with the South Korean military, and the tempo of joint training exercises has picked up since Trump left office. South Korea last published a national security strategy in 2018. It emphasized outreach to North Korea but, critically, did not frame such overtures as a substitute for the alliance with the United States.@@South Korea had good reason to drift away from the United States. Trump repeatedly publicly condemned it, and it is governed by a coalition with roots in anti-American protest. But it did not. Like the actions of the other allies, Seoul\u2019s approach was to flatter and persevere, not bolt.@@Each of these four allies chose to tolerate Trump\u2019s abuse rather than distance itself from Washington. This choice was a reflection not of Trump\u2019s persona or acumen but of the reality of U.S. power. However humiliating, accommodating Trump was cheaper than the potential costs of distancing themselves from the United States.@@Perhaps U.S. allies restrained themselves. They might have seen Trump as a bizarre, one-off outcome of the unusual U.S. presidential election system, and so they politely chose to bite their tongues. Had Trump been reelected, the allies might then have shifted to more independent foreign policies. But that seems unlikely. These allies had faced the erratic consequences of the U.S. presidential election system just a little more than a decade before. President George\u00a0W. Bush was maligned as a unilateralist cowboy who led a hyperpower into an aggressive, unnecessary war. But when Bush was reelected in 2004, nothing happened. Then as now, the structures of the U.S. alliance system stayed intact, and the core European and Asian prot\u00e9g\u00e9s remained committed to their U.S. patron.@@Trump may have raised the hackles of the U.S. @@establishment more than he alarmed the governments of allied countries. But even if Berlin, Paris, Tokyo, or Seoul was so perturbed by Trump that it felt compelled to do something, its options were limited and costly. Would it suddenly pursue an independent foreign policy at great expense in the face of Chinese and Russian power? These allied governments and the strategy documents they produced never seriously considered alternatives to an alliance with the United States, even under a possible second Trump term, because those choices were all too costly.@@The costs of delinking from the U.S. military, for instance, would be high. Germany, France, and Japan spend less than two percent of their GDPs on their militaries and are decidedly uninterested in matching the U.S. figure of over three percent. Worse, most U.S. allies are now tacitly dependent on the United States for the logistical and administrative depth required by modern combat operations, as illustrated by France and the United Kingdom\u2019s dependence on U.S. logistics in the 2011 intervention in Libya and Japan\u2019s and South Korea\u2019s dependence on the U.S. Navy to participate in antipiracy actions in the Indian Ocean.@@Any attempt to meaningfully hedge against the United States would require substantial spending increases, massive expansions of recruitment (including the expansion of conscription in South Korea), and other costly moves that might rankle taxpayers and voters. Erstwhile allies would also risk the economic ramifications of falling afoul of the United States. Access to the world\u2019s largest open market is crucial for their growth, particularly for export-driven, mercantilist economies such as Japan and South Korea. Trump made clear his willingness to leverage allies\u2019 trade dependence and target allies with tariffs.@@But perhaps the most powerful factor keeping the allies bound to the United States is the reality that they don\u2019t really have anywhere else to turn. For democracies, a certain scorn for allying with dictatorships is natural, and options such as rapprochement with China or Russia or an inter-Korean federation have obvious political risks. The persistence of the animosity between Japan and South Korea and of the competitive rivalry between France and Germany would complicate efforts by these powers to band together on their own. Humiliation by Trump was a small price to pay in the absence of better options.@@The U.S. alliance system is predicated on hierarchy and dependency. Trump\u2019s treatment of U.S. allies was boorish and unnecessarily hostile, likely driven by egotistical cravings for status and masculine domination. A general contempt for his behavior is appropriate, but that behavior also illuminated, however harshly, two long-standing truths about U.S. alliances.@@These relationships are deeply unequal. This point is frequently obscured by U.S. rhetoric about solidarity and standing \u201cshoulder to shoulder\u201d with allies. Such language masks fundamental power imbalances and the fact that U.S. alliances ultimately rest on an alignment of interests. As the political scientists Patrick Porter and Joshua Shifrinson have argued, the American predilection for calling allies \u201cfriends\u201d breeds false expectations and encourages allies with underpowered militaries to assume Washington will tolerate their piggybacking on U.S. defense guarantees. Because of their shared liberal values, U.S. allies are also inclined to believe that the United States will solicit and respect their opinions. But these allies then complain of bullying when U.S. indifference to their viewpoints lays bare the fundamental asymmetries of their relationships with the United States, as happened under Trump and as happened again last summer when Biden withdrew from Afghanistan while ignoring NATO allies\u2019 objections. To remedy this, U.S. allies should address the root causes of Washington\u2019s ability to ride roughshod over them: their low defense spending and their consequent weak power projection capabilities.@@The Trump years also underlined the fact that the U.S. alliance system is not in decline. A wider liberal international order\u2014reliant on reasonably liberal behavior from nondemocracies, especially China, in a rule-bound trading network\u2014may indeed be eroding. But the more limited, patron-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 arrangement between the United States and its core allies in Europe and Asia appears stable. U.S. allies still want this structure.@@Ideally, the United States would behave solicitously toward and cooperatively with its allies. Trump\u2019s crude belligerence was both reprehensible and, in practical terms, pointless. But the record of the Trump period strongly suggests that, although desirable, it is not necessary for the United States to be diplomatic in its relations with its allies. U.S. alliances are asymmetric and are becoming more so as the power projection capabilities of the junior partners atrophy. The United States has a lot of unused leverage to push its allies even harder. It can neglect them without reprisal, even if many commentators do not think it should. Trump produced a clarifying moment; for a few years, he starkly revealed that U.S. allies have a high threshold for mistreatment and bullying. Attestations of American decline, which would likely entail the defection of U.S. allies to other patrons, are exaggerated.@@This realization should allow the Biden administration to demand more from U.S. allies than most administrations have asked for in the past, particularly in the realm of defense spending. The United States can at times bully its allies because they rely on American power. The politesse of reassurance may be desirable and decorous, but U.S. allies are not about to abandon their patron.", "download_timeout": 180.0, "download_slot": "www.foreignaffairs.com",

Permissions The Russian-Ukrainian war of 2022 is not just a major geopolitical event but also a geoeconomic turning point. Western sanctions are the toughest measures ever imposed against a state of Russia\u2019s size and power. In the space of less than three weeks, the United States and its allies have cut major Russian banks off from the global financial system; blocked the export of high-tech components in unison with Asian allies; seized the overseas assets of hundreds of wealthy oligarchs; revoked trade treaties with Moscow; banned Russian airlines from North Atlantic airspace: restricted Russian oil sales to the United States and United Kingdom; blocked all foreign investment in the Russian economy from their jurisdiction; and frozen $403 billion out of the $630 billion in foreign assets of the Central Bank of Russia. The overall effect has been unprecedented, and a few weeks ago would have seemed unimaginable even to most experts: in all but its most vital products, the world\u2019s eleventh-largest economy has now been decoupled from twenty-first-century globalization. How will these historic measures play out? Economic sanctions rarely succeed at achieving their goals. Western policymakers frequently assume that failures stem from weaknesses in sanctions design. Indeed, sanctions can be plagued by loopholes, lack of political will to implement them, or insufficient diplomatic agreement concerning enforcement. The implicit assumption is that stronger sanctions stand a better chance of succeeding. Yet the Western economic containment of Russia is different. This is an unprecedented campaign to isolate a G-20 economy with a large hydrocarbon sector, a sophisticated military-industrial complex, and a diversified basket of commodity exports. As a result, Western sanctions face a different kind of problem. The sanctions, in this case, could fail not because of their weakness but because of their great and unpredictable strength. Having grown accustomed to using sanctions against smaller countries at low cost, Western policymakers have only limited experience and understanding of the effects of truly severe measures against a major, globally connected economy. Existing fragilities in the world\u2019s economic and financial structure mean that such sanctions have the potential to cause grave political and material fallout.  THE REAL SHOCK AND AWE Just how severe the current sanctions against Russia are can be seen from their effects across the world. The immediate shock to the Russian economy is the most obvious. Economists  expect  Russian GDP to contract by at least 9\u201315 percent this year, but the damage could well become much more severe. The ruble has fallen more than a third since the beginning of January. An exodus of skilled Russian professionals is underway, while the capacity to import consumer goods and valuable technology has fallen drastically. As Russian political scientist Ilya Matveev has  put it , \u201c30 years of economic development thrown into the bin.\u201d The ramifications of the Western sanctions go far beyond these effects on Russia itself. There are at least four different kinds of broader effects: spillover effects into adjacent countries and markets; multiplier effects through private-sector divestment; escalation effects in the form of Russian responses; and systemic effects on the  global economy . Spillover effects have already caused  turmoil in international commodities markets . A generalized panic erupted among traders after the second Western sanctions package\u2014including the SWIFT cutoff and the freezing of central bank reserves\u2014was announced on February 26. Prices of crude oil, natural gas, wheat, copper, nickel, aluminum, fertilizers, and gold have soared. Because the war has closed Ukrainian ports and international firms are shunning Russian commodity exports, a grain and metals shortage now looms over the global economy. Although oil prices have since dropped in anticipation of additional output from Gulf producers, the price shock to energy and commodities across the board will push global inflation higher. African and Asian countries reliant on food and energy imports are already experiencing difficulties.  Economists expect Russian GDP to contract by at least 9 to 15 percent this year. Central Asia\u2019s economies are also caught up in the sanctions shock. These former Soviet states are strongly connected to the Russian economy through trade and outward labor migration. The collapse of the ruble has caused serious  financial distress  in the region. Kazakhstan has imposed exchange controls after the tenge, its currency, fell by 20 percent in the wake of the Western sanctions against Moscow; Tajikistan\u2019s somoni has undergone a similarly steep depreciation. Russia\u2019s impending impoverishment will force millions of Central Asian migrant workers to seek employment elsewhere and dry up the flow of remittances to their home countries.  The impact of the sanctions goes beyond decisions taken by G-7 and EU governments. The official sanctions packages have had a catalyzing effect on international businesses operating in Russia. Virtually overnight, Russia\u2019s impending isolation has set in motion a massive corporate flight. In what amounts to a vast private sector boycott, hundreds of major Western firms in the technology, oil and gas, aerospace, car, manufacturing, consumer goods, food and beverage, accounting and financial, and transport industries are pulling out of the country. It is noteworthy that these departures are in many cases not required by sanctions. Instead, they are driven by moral condemnation, reputational concerns, and outright panic. As a result, the business retreat is deepening the economic shock to Russia by multiplying the negative economic effects of official state sanctions.  The Russian government has responded to the sanctions in several ways. It has undertaken emergency stabilization policies to protect foreign exchange earnings and shore up the ruble. Foreign portfolio capital is being locked into the country. While the stock market has remained closed, the assets of many Western firms that have departed may soon face confiscation. The Ministry of Economic Development has  prepared a law  that grants the Russian state six months to take over businesses in case of an \u201cungrounded\u201d liquidation or bankruptcy.  The potential nationalization of Western capital is not the only escalatory effect of the sanctions. On March 9, Putin  signed an order  restricting Russian commodity exports. Although the full array of items to be withheld under the ban is not yet clear, the threat of its use will continue to hang over international trade. Russian  restrictions on fertilizer exports  imposed in early February have already  put pressure on global food production . Russia could retaliate by restricting exports of important minerals such as nickel, palladium, and industrial sapphires. These are crucial inputs for the production of electrical batteries, catalytic converters, phones, ball bearings, light tubes, and microchips. In the globalized assemblage system, even small changes in materials prices can massively raise the production costs faced by final users downstream in the production chain. A Russian embargo or large export reduction of palladium, nickel, or sapphires would hit car and semiconductor manufacturers, a $3.4 trillion global industry. If the economic war between the West and Russia continues further into 2022 at this intensity, it is very possible that the world will slide into a sanctions-induced recession. MANAGING THE FALLOUT The combination of spillover effects, negative multiplier effects, and escalation effects means that the sanctions against Russia will have an effect on the world economy like few previous sanctions regimes in history. Why was this great upheaval not anticipated? One reason is that over the last few decades, U.S. policymakers have usually deployed sanctions against economies that were sufficiently modest in size for any significant adverse effects to be contained. The degree of integration into the world economy of North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Myanmar, and Belarus was relatively modest and one-dimensional. Only the rollout of U.S. sanctions against Iran required special care to avoid upsetting the oil market. In general, however, the assumption held that sanctions use was economically almost costless to the United States. This has meant that the macroeconomic and macrofinancial consequences of global sanctions are insufficiently understood.  To better grasp the choices to be made in the current economic sanctions against Russia, it is instructive to examine sanctions use in the 1930s, when democracies similarly attempted to use them to stop the aggression of large-sized autocratic economies such as Fascist Italy, imperial Japan, and Nazi Germany. The crucial backdrop to these efforts was the Great Depression, which had weakened economies and inflamed nationalism around the world. When Italian dictator Benito Mussolini invaded Ethiopia in October 1935, the League of Nations implemented an international sanctions regime enforced by 52 countries. It was an impressive united response, similar to that on display in reaction to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.  But the league sanctions came with real tradeoffs. Economic containment of Fascist Italy limited democracies\u2019 ability to use sanctions against an aggressor who was more threatening still: Adolf Hitler. As a major engine of export demand for smaller European economies, Germany was too large an economy to be isolated without severe commercial loss to the whole of Europe. Amid the fragile recovery from the Depression, simultaneously placing sanctions on both Italy and Germany\u2014then the fourth- and seventh-largest economies in the world\u2014was too costly for most democracies. Hitler exploited this fear of overstretch and the international focus on Ethiopia by moving German troops into the demilitarized Rhineland in March 1936, advancing further toward war. German officials were aware of their  commercial power , which they used to maneuver central European and Balkan economies into their political orbit. The result was the creation of a continental, river-based bloc of vassal economies whose trade with Germany was harder for Western states to block with sanctions or a naval blockade. The sanctions dilemmas of the 1930s show that aggressors should be confronted when they disrupt the international order. But it equally drives home the fact that the viability of sanctions, and the chances of their success, are always dependent on the global economic situation. In unstable commercial and financial conditions, it will be necessary to prioritize among competing objectives and prepare thoroughly for unintended effects of all kinds. Using sanctions against very large economies will simply not be possible without compensatory policies that support the sanctioners\u2019 economies and the rest of the world.  More intensive sanctions will inflict further damage to the world economy. The Biden administration is aware of this problem, but its actions so far are inadequate to the scale  of the problem . Washington has attempted to reduce strains in the oil market by a partial reconciliation with Iran and Venezuela. Countering the spillover effects of sanctions against one leading petrostate may now require lifting sanctions on two smaller petrostates. But this oil diplomacy is insufficient to meet the challenge posed by the Russia sanctions, the effects of which are aggravating preexisting economic woes. Supply chain issues and pandemic-era bottlenecks in global transport and production networks predated the war in Ukraine. The unprecedented use of sanctions in these already troubled conditions has made an already difficult situation worse.  The problem of managing the fallout of economic war is greater still in Europe. This is not only because the European Union has much stronger trade and  energy links  with Russia. It is also the result of the political economy of the eurozone as it has taken shape over the last two decades: with the exception of France, most of its economies follow a heavily trade-reliant, export-focused growth strategy. This economic model requires foreign demand for exports while repressing wages and domestic demand. It is a structure that is very ill suited to the prolonged imposition of trade-reducing sanctions. Increasing EU-wide renewable energy investment and expanding public control in the energy sector, as French President Emmanuel Macron  has announced , is one way to absorb this shock. But there is also a need for income-boosting measures for consumer goods and price-dampening interventions in producer goods markets, from  strategic reserve management  to the  excess profits taxes  that are being rolled out in Spain and Italy.  Then there are the consequences of sanctions cause for the world economy at large, especially in the \u201cglobal South.\u201d Addressing these problems will pose a major macroeconomic challenge. It is therefore imperative for the G-7, the European Union, and the United States\u2019 Asian partners to launch bold and coordinated action to stabilize global markets. This can be done through targeted investment to clear up supply bottlenecks, generous international grants and loans to developing countries struggling to secure adequate food and energy supplies, and large-scale government funding for renewable energy capacity. It will also have to involve subsidies, and perhaps even rationing and price controls, to protect the poorest from the destructive effects of surging food, energy, and commodity prices. Such state intervention is the price to be paid for engaging in economic war. Inflicting material damage at the scale levelled against Russia simply cannot be pursued without an international policymaking shift that extends economic support to those  affected by sanctions . Unless the material well-being of households is protected, political support for sanctions will crumble over time. THE NEW INTERVENTIONISTS Western policymakers thus face a serious decision. They must decide whether to uphold sanctions against Russia at their current strength or to impose further economic punishment on Putin. If the goal of the sanctions is to exert maximum pressure on Russia with minimal disruption to their own economies\u2014and thus a manageable risk of domestic political backlash\u2014then current levels of pressure may be the most that is politically feasible now.  At the moment, simply maintaining existing sanctions will require active compensatory policies. For Europe especially, neither  laissez-faire economic policies  nor fiscal fragmentation will be sustainable if the economic war persists. But if the West decides to step up the economic pressure on Russia further still, far-reaching economic interventions will become an absolute necessity. More intensive sanctions will inflict further damage, not just to the sanctioners themselves but to the world economy at large. No matter how strong  and justified  the West\u2019s resolve to stop Putin\u2019s aggression is,  policymakers must accept   the material reality  that an  all-out economic offensive  will introduce considerable new strains into the world economy.  An intensification of sanctions will cause a cascade of material shocks that will demand far-reaching stabilization efforts. And even with such rescue measures, the economic damage may well be serious, and the risks of strategic escalation will remain high. For all these reasons, it remains vital to pursue diplomatic and economic paths that can end the conflict. Whatever the results of the war, the economic offensive against Russia has already exposed one important new reality: the era of costless, risk-free, and predictable sanctions is well and truly over.

save to read later Print this article Send by email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Get a link Request Reprint Permissions In the spring of 2021, a Russia-based cybercrime group launched a ransomware attack against the largest fuel pipeline in the United States. According to the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, the subsequent shutdown and gas shortage across the East Coast likely originated from a single compromised password. That an individual misstep might disrupt critical services for millions illustrates just how vulnerable the United States\u2019 digital ecosystem is in the twenty-first century.  Although most participants in the cyber-ecosystem are aware of these growing risks, the responsibility for mitigating systemic hazards is poorly distributed. Cyber-professionals and policymakers are too often motivated more by a fear of risk than by an aspiration to realize cyberspace\u2019s full potential. Exacerbating this dynamic is a decades-old tendency among the large and sophisticated actors who design, construct, and operate digital systems to devolve the cost and difficulty of risk mitigation onto users who often lack the resources and expertise to address them.  Too often, this state of affairs produces digital ecosystems where private information is easily accessible, predatory technology is inexpensive, and momentary lapses in vigilance can snowball into a continent-wide catastrophe. Although individually oriented tools like multifactor authentication and password managers are critical to solving elements of this problem, they are inadequate on their own. A durable solution must involve moving away from the tendency to charge isolated individuals, small businesses, and local governments with shouldering absurd levels of risk. Those more capable of carrying the load\u2014such as governments and large firms\u2014must take on some of the burden, and collective, collaborative defense needs to replace atomized and divided efforts. Until then, the problem will always look like someone else\u2019s to solve. The United States needs a new social contract for the digital age\u2014one that meaningfully alters the relationship between public and private sectors and proposes a new set of obligations for each. Such a shift is momentous but not without precedent. From the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 to the Clean Air Act of 1963 and the public-private revolution in airline safety in the 1990s, the United States has made important adjustments following profound changes in the economy and technology. A similarly innovative shift in the cyber-realm will likely require an intense process of development and iteration. Still, its contours are already clear: the private sector must prioritize long-term investments in a digital ecosystem that equitably distributes the burden of cyberdefense. Government, in turn, must provide more timely and comprehensive threat information while simultaneously treating industry as a vital partner. Finally, both the public and private sectors must commit to moving toward true collaboration\u2014contributing resources, attention, expertise, and people toward institutions designed to prevent, counter, and recover from cyber-incidents.  Although success is far from guaranteed, the benefits of such a social contract are enormous. A new vision of what the U.S. government, firms, and individuals owe one another in cyberspace\u2014unburdened by contemporary visions of risk and threat\u2014ultimately means a world capable of achieving its full technological potential.  A DREAM DEFERRED Contemporary cyberthreats represent a tragic betrayal of what leading technology advocates promised at the dawn of the digital revolution. The heady early days of the Internet were suffused with optimism. Digital connectivity, many argued, would not only favor democracy and human rights but would also serve as an inherent force of progress and egalitarianism. After the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, it was easy to see the Internet as a natural and inevitable extension of liberalizing geopolitical forces\u2014heralding a world where neither physical borders nor governmental authorities would constrain the free flow of ideas.  It soon became clear, however, that cyberspace was a tool like any other\u2014one that would amplify the values of those who wielded it. China, initially held up as a quintessential case of liberalization-by-commerce, did precisely what techno-optimists thought impossible: it tamed the Internet, harnessed cyberspace, and subverted the digital revolution into a digital dystopia that Beijing now seeks to export to aspiring authoritarians worldwide.  Russia , whose Soviet forebears were partly defeated by the free flow of information, is now a virtuosic purveyor of disinformation, digital manipulation, and cyber-enabled geopolitical blackmail. Individuals and small businesses, meanwhile, have only partially realized the promise of a radically egalitarian digital economy. Market gains have disproportionately accrued to a few large firms. The digital criminal underground, by contrast, is far more democratic. Hacking tools are readily available, enabling cybercriminals to hold critical infrastructure hostage. The digital hopes of the 1990s are now interlaced with a series of catastrophic threats. With that backdrop, it should come as no surprise that many cyberpolicies proceed from a fundamentally negative framing that cedes the initiative to transgressors and places excessive faith in market incentives. There is merit to these concerns: the security challenges in cyberspace are daunting because the scope and scale of any one security incident can be so vast. In a world where clicking the wrong link or neglecting a single software patch can result in a geopolitical incident, responders often focus on an attack\u2019s perpetrator at the expense of addressing the perverse incentives that create these circumstances in the first place. Such framing has serious material consequences, however. Security is a prerequisite for prosperity in the physical world, and cyberspace is no different. Until Washington develops a better understanding of what digitally enabled prosperity might look like, the United States will continue to miss out on cyberspace\u2019s original purpose: the ambitious realization of a better world, a more equitable economy, and a more just society. A NEW SOCIAL CONTRACT Neither market incentives nor existing threats are immutable forces of nature. Change is possible, and it is wholly consistent with American values for government to collaborate with the private sector to mitigate risk and better serve public interests. The best way to begin this reset is by increasing collaboration within the U.S. government and\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014creating a clear framework for collaboration across the public and private elements of the  United States \u2019 shared cyber-ecosystem.  The U.S. government has made great strides in the former. The Biden administration has unveiled a series of whole-of-government initiatives meant to apprehend criminals, isolate and sanction their enablers, and mobilize like-minded states to defend against state-backed hacking campaigns. Across the public and private sector, however, there remains little common understanding of what an organization ought to do or to whom it should turn when preparing for or responding to an intrusion. Governments, firms, and citizens alike too often have no authoritative answer to the question of what we owe one another in cyberspace. The answer to that question requires collaboration among the U.S. government, the private sector, and their international counterparts. Situational awareness\u2014the kind needed to understand threats that operate across organizational boundaries\u2014is only possible if each organization contributes its fractional views to a shared understanding of a common threat. Collaboration between cyberdefenders can turn the tables on attackers, but only if every stakeholder understands how their part fits into the whole and under what circumstances they must be ready to step in to help.  The United States needs a new social contract for the digital age. As in other industries charged with providing critical services, however, market forces alone are insufficient to ensure that cyberspace serves all of its stakeholders equitably. Consistent with best practices derived from the transportation and medical sectors, government and private firms must begin to work together. Above all, that means developing new ways to address the disproportionate burden that the current system places on individuals and end users. Cyberspace is made up of overwhelmingly private components yet has incalculable public value. Private sector firms will, therefore, need to increasingly prioritize security and resilience in both their hardware manufacturing and software development, even if those priorities require more patience from their occasionally impatient investors. The government must also play an active role in easing that transition\u2014setting standards, incentivizing norms, and providing information. Both sides also need to match these actions with a novel vision for collaboration. Building resilience to potentially catastrophic cyber-incidents will require an unprecedented level of planning, information sharing, and operational intimacy across once-isolated fields. Existing efforts to place government and industry experts side-by-side\u2014including in sector-specific Information Sharing and Analysis Centers \u2014 are a good way to start. The U.S. government has quickly realized that these partnerships can identify and address threats far more effectively than a single organization operating alone. President Joe Biden\u2019s May 2021 executive order on improving U.S. cybersecurity is a vital element of this new paradigm. The order is designed to foster resilient software supply chains by strengthening information technology standards and defending networks against known vulnerabilities. Security researchers have long called for many of the order\u2019s new initiatives, including a so-called software bill of materials program designed to track various components used in software development. Biden\u2019s announcement, moreover, will help disseminate these practices well beyond the public sector alone.  The federal government will also need to lead by example when building its own digital systems. In November 2021, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a novel directive requiring all federal agencies to patch more than 250 known software vulnerabilities that hackers were actively exploiting. In January 2022, the administration unveiled its  strategy  for implementing a government-wide zero-trust architecture\u2014a security philosophy that assumes breaches are inevitable and builds in firebreaks to contain the impact of any potential hack. Such a program lowers the risk of any single vulnerability, moving the United States away  from  a system that too often concentrates risk on individuals\u2019 digital slip-ups. Beyond simply urging a change of direction and strategy, the federal government is getting its own digital house in order and blazing a path that others can follow.  Cyberthreats represent a betrayal of what advocates promised at the dawn of the digital revolution. Translating this level of mobilization into systemic change across the private sector will be a more difficult proposition. Doing so will require an unprecedented level of collaboration between government and industry. As a start, the Biden administration is setting up a new Cyber Safety Review Board modeled after the National Transportation Safety Board. Government and private sector leaders will co-chair this body with an intent to analyze significant cybersecurity incidents, generate lessons learned, and produce concrete recommendations to avoid future crises. Washington is also easing contractual barriers that once prevented private sector actors from sharing threat information with authorities and requiring government service providers to notify federal agencies of relevant data breaches. Finally, the Biden administration established the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative at CISA, a first-of-its-kind organization with authority to bring together representatives from government and industry to identify threats, develop crisis response plans, and foster the relationships needed  to respond   to  malicious cyber-incidents.  This level of collaboration will require professional and operational intimacy among practitioners and considerable experience in developing plans for exceptional events. CISA, for instance, will need to convene whole-of-nation exercises designed to anticipate particular contingencies and identify the agencies responsible for specific elements of crisis response. CISA and its fellow risk management agencies across the rest of the federal government will also need to carry out their responsibilities alongside their counterpart industries. Private and public sector leaders will need to learn how to speak one another\u2019s languages and productively share information. And the National Security Council will need to coordinate the deployment of all tools of national power when a  cyber problem suddenly becomes a  geopolitical  problem.  Like any well-functioning team, however, the U.S. government also needs to regularly review its performance. This is another area where the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) can prove its worth. From its position in the White House, ONCD must use its perspective to champion and drive coherence across U.S. cyberpolicy. That should include carefully reviewing budgets to identify effective policies and translating national strategies into planning priorities for specific agencies. ONCD must also identify weaknesses in Washington\u2019s crash course in public-private cooperation and repair organizational issues before they become serious problems. Cyberspace is the world\u2019s largest public good composed almost entirely of private components, and ONCD, armed with its statutory responsibility to consult and coordinate with private sector actors, must work as the government\u2019s translator. Finally, because cyberspace is not a purely domestic issue, ONCD should work alongside the State Department and National Security Council to ensure that lessons learned flow freely between the United States and its partners. PRESENT AT THE CREATION With this new social contract for cyberspace\u2014based around   investments in resilience, new forms of information sharing, and public-private collaboration\u2014the United States will be well placed to reclaim the hope present at the dawn of the digital age. Although Americans have grown skeptical that the Internet is a net positive development for society, unrealized promise abounds at the intersection of public and private collaboration. By revamping its understanding of whom and what cyberspace is ultimately for, the United States will be poised to reap untold social, economic, and geopolitical benefits. The tech sector, for one, is already a significant engine of innovation and growth\u2014constituting nearly ten percent of the United States\u2019 total economic output. Seven of the ten most profitable U.S.  companies  are technology, telecommunications, or software firms. Eighty-five percent of Americans own a smartphone, up from 35 percent just ten years ago\u2014a signal of just how deeply digital connectivity is woven into the fabric of American life. And when COVID-19 arrived, 90 percent of Americans said the Internet became essential or important to weathering the unprecedented disruption brought by a global pandemic.  Digital connectivity is not only helping individuals cope with COVID-19, however. Technology is also assisting governments, scientists, and companies to manage and ultimately end the pandemic. Since 2020, a historic global mobilization of biomedical research has transformed science in the digital age. COVID-19 researchers piloted new practices for rapidly sharing data and results\u2014frequently circulating so-called preprint papers to disseminate vital discoveries all while maintaining data security and integrity. When scientists first sequenced an early version of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in January 2020, for instance, researchers at the biotechnology firm Moderna and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases simply downloaded the genome, swapped out one viral protein for another, and began testing a vaccine within six weeks.  Aligning market incentives to realize a low-carbon future requires attention and creativity. Vitally, this newfound speed did not entail sacrifices in quality. Instead, digital connectivity helped strengthen medical science\u2019s ethical, doctrinal, and procedural underpinnings, allowing it to operate at higher speeds without sacrificing public safety. The protections and controls that researchers built into every layer of their work\u2014how they designed their experiments, collected and handled their data, selected and operated their tools and materials\u2014created layers of risk mitigation that produced a faster and higher-performing industry. Although the international community still faces political hurdles to vaccinating the most vulnerable, the public now understands what is truly possible. Beyond issues such as COVID-19, however, the United States has scarcely begun to imagine what a similar high-performance, high-confidence framework\u2014with significant safeguards built into its design\u2014could accomplish in other fields. As with biomedical research, the policies, processes, and technologies necessary for a stable and secure Internet are not a drag on speed but actually allow innovators to unfurl their initiatives more quickly and confidently. The United States should therefore develop its  cyberstrategies , policies, and partnerships not by solely fixating on the most imminent threats but by remembering the promise that lies ahead. By more clearly articulating the digitally enabled world where Americans want to live, the path forward will become increasingly achievable. \u00a0 A BRIGHT FUTURE It is impossible to predict what an ideal digital and collaborative future might look like, but its broad benefits are increasingly visible. Some elements that hold clear promise when paired with a newly secure and durable digital ecosystem already exist. Others are more speculative. In all cases, however, a world where scientists, innovators, governments, and individuals have the confidence to move faster in cyberspace is one where the future is bright. One of the most promising and urgent possibilities involves the transition to renewable energy. Although the Biden administration\u2019s once-in-a-generation Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act investments will accelerate this movement, the promise of renewable energy is about more than just slowing climate change. Green energy can ultimately enable a more ambitious and compelling future than fossil fuels could ever provide. U.S. per capita energy use grew rapidly as the United States industrialized but plateaued after the 1970s as rising oil prices and pollution drove industry to do more with less. The cost of solar panels, meanwhile, has declined rapidly\u2014more than 80 percent since 2010. When combined with the near-zero marginal cost of converting sunlight to electricity, energy may soon become too cheap to meter. Analysts have barely begun to imagine what a U.S. economy unchained from energy scarcity and pollution could accomplish. Aligning market incentives to realize this low-carbon future requires attention and creativity. The same is true for the secure and resilient digital foundation that such a system would ultimately utilize. Solar energy, for example, is uniquely scalable\u2014from the rooftops of individual homes to utility-scale solar farms. Designed correctly, the digital infrastructure underpinning this hypothetical energy network could generate, store, and redistribute electricity at a level contemporary fossil fuels simply cannot match. With ironclad data security, operators could trust automated software to distribute power with an unprecedented level of sophistication. Southern sunshine could backstop Iowans staring down winter storms, while offshore winds in Maine could charge electric vehicles up and down the East Coast. Also promising and similarly urgent is the rapidly developing space-based economy. Like renewable energy, this new sector will hinge on cybersecurity and technology security. Orbital launch costs are declining, and satellite technology is increasingly available\u2014opening up new opportunities for commercial and geopolitical competition alike. Although space-based telecommunication systems already exist, businesses, governments, nonprofits, and researchers alike need confidence in the security and resilience of the orbital investments they make and the data those systems provide. Precise climate change models, game-changing agricultural insights, real-time measurements of macroeconomic trends, and worldwide Internet connectivity may be just around the corner, but only if the hardware and software that provide these services remain trustworthy, resilient, and operational. This will only happen once the United States reaches an entirely different level of confidence in its cybersecurity underpinnings. As any motorsports fan knows, drivers can take corners faster when they have confidence in their brakes.  By identifying the digital future the United States wants to create, Americans can fortify their resilience. Autonomous vehicles may be one such technology. The promise of vehicle autonomy is clear: safer and easier transportation of people and goods, reduced driver fatigue, vastly more efficient use of passenger and freight networks, and improved freedom of movement for the disabled or displaced. The threats posed by an insecure cyber-ecosystem, however, are equally clear: autonomous fleets will inevitably depend on densely networked systems and software guidance that are currently vulnerable to malicious attacks. The uniquely real-time and high-stakes use of artificial intelligence that truly autonomous vehicles would require necessitates paradigm-shifting cyber-protections. Once realized, these developments could usher in the most profound and positive change to the modern world\u2019s built environment in decades. \u00a0 Such bright futures also extend into geopolitics. Just as analysts often fixate on cyberthreats to the detriment of cyberbenefits, the implications of a future where the United States prevails over contemporary geopolitical threats are similarly understudied. A world in which U.S. and  allied  networks are resilient against state-backed hacking campaigns, for instance, would be a profoundly different one. If China or Russia had fewer plausible avenues for subverting the digital infrastructure that underpins the United States\u2019 conventional tools of deterrence, the calculus of strategic competition would likely shift significantly in favor of the United States. The United States would also stand to benefit if China and Russia were prevented from prepositioning malware in critical U.S. infrastructure, thereby decreasing Beijing and Moscow\u2019s ability to wield asymmetric weapons in a crisis.  And although the U.S. public is broadly aware of Chinese espionage and intellectual property theft, analysts are comparatively less aware of Beijing\u2019s growing ability to weaponize Americans\u2019 individual data. According to William Evanina, former director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center,  China has  \u201cvacuumed up the personal data of much of the American population, including data on our health, finances, travel and other sensitive information.\u201d   China is almost certainly using these vast datasets to develop models for an array of nefarious purposes, including identifying intelligence agents, stymying U.S. diplomacy, tracking influential leaders, targeting Beijing\u2019s espionage campaigns, and even influencing voters. Individuals\u2019 personal data is not only the lifeblood of the digital economy, it also fuels the weapons that target that economy. A durable and secure digital ecosystem, by contrast, would short-circuit such malign activity.  Finally, a world where data is more secure is a world where data privacy becomes more enforceable. Americans are increasingly confused and anxious over the lack of control over their personal information, and the regular drumbeat of mass breaches does little to soothe their nerves. By contrast, an absolutely secure digital world is one where a comprehensive privacy regime becomes more practical. With greater certainty over the direction of the United States\u2019 data security and privacy environment, U.S. firms would also find it easier to work with the data regimes of like-minded partners. Such collaboration would enable deeper interoperability and commercial exchange with countries such as Japan or those in the European Union that have already begun laying the foundations of twenty-first-century data law. U.S. diplomats would also be able to credibly wield these values as foreign policy tools to strengthen relations with allies and partners across the globe. The resulting international ties would help constrain the spread of Beijing and Moscow\u2019s surveillance technologies and digital authoritarianism.\u00a0\u00a0  These futures may be rosy, but they are not implausible. By focusing Washington\u2019s attention on realizing a preferred digital future, the United States will not only be able to identify malign actors seeking to obstruct U.S. success, it will also be able to generate a more actionable understanding of what Americans need from one another. Many digitally driven sectors have become victims of their own success. Over the past few decades, a series of small and innovative firms have become custodians of a vital new establishment. Rarely is there a clear tipping point when a startup\u2019s mission transitions from creative destruction to societal maintenance. But with a shared and affirmative vision, the public and private sectors can build a new social contract that facilitates that transition without undermining the integrity and vitality essential to an innovative economy.  By identifying the digital future the United States wants to create and the social contract that could sustain it, Americans can fortify their resilience and establish rewards for good behavior and costs for bad behavior. Misaligned incentives and malicious actors are no match for a clear vision of where the United States wants to go.  Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

In 2017, the last year for which there are complete data, roughly four million Americans with security clearances classified around 50 million documents at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of around $18 billion. For a short time, I was one of those four million. From 2014 to 2015, I worked for the general counsel of the Department of Defense, a position for which I received a security clearance at the \u201ctop secret\u201d level. I came into the job thinking that all the classified documents I would see would include important national security secrets accessible only to those who had gone through an extensive background check and been placed in a position of trust. I was shocked to discover that much of what I read was in fact not all that different from what was available on the Internet. There were exceptions: events I learned about a few hours or even days before the rest of the world, for instance, and information that could be traced to intelligence sources. But the vast bulk of the classified material I saw was remarkable only for how unremarkable it was. The U.S. system for classifying secrets is based on the idea that the government has access to significant information that is not available, or at least not widely available, to private citizens or organizations. Over time, however, government intelligence sources have lost their advantage over private sources of intelligence. Thanks to new surveillance and monitoring technologies, including geolocation trackers, the Internet of Things, and commercial satellites, private information is now often better\u2014sometimes much better\u2014than the information held by governments. At the same time, these technologies have given rise to an altogether new threat: troves of personal data, many of them readily available, that can be exploited by  foreign powers . Each new piece of information, by itself, is relatively unimportant. But combined, the pieces can give foreign adversaries unprecedented insight into the personal lives of most Americans. Yet the United States has not begun to adapt its system for protecting information. It remains focused on keeping too many secrets that don\u2019t really matter, treating government information like the crown jewels while leaving private data almost entirely unguarded. This overemphasis on secrecy at the expense of privacy isn\u2019t just inefficient. It undermines American democracy and, increasingly, U.S. national security, as well.\u00a0 The U.S. government did not always keep so many secrets. At the turn of the twentieth century, in fact, it had no formal nationwide system of secrecy. That began to change after Japan defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, stunning Western countries and signaling the rise of a new regional power in Asia capable of challenging the major powers in Europe. Japan had long prohibited emigration, but it had lifted this restriction in 1886, just as its military prowess was beginning to grow. By 1908, around 150,000 Japanese immigrants had entered the United States.\u00a0 As the number of new arrivals ticked up, American newspapers began reporting stories about \u201cJapanese spies roaming about the Philippines, Hawaii, and the continental United States, busily making drawings of the location of guns, mines, and other weapons of defense,\u201d as  The  Atlanta Constitution  put it in 1911. Journalists at  The Courier-Journal  detailed a sophisticated Japanese spying operation in Los Angeles, Portland, and the harbors around Puget Sound, including rumors that \u201cagents of the Japanese War Office, in the guise of railroad section laborers or servants in families residing in the locality, are stationed at every large railroad bridge on the Pacific coast.\u201d These stories were fantastic\u2014and likely false, for the most part, as were widespread tales of Japanese candy store operators who were really mapmakers, Japanese fishermen who were really taking harbor soundings, and Japanese barbers who picked up military secrets from their unsuspecting clients. Members of Congress, alarmed by the stories, decided to act. The Defense Secrets Act, passed in 1911, was the first U.S. law to criminalize spying. It provided that \u201cwhoever, . . . without proper authority, obtains, takes, or makes, or attempts to obtain, take, or make, any document, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, plan, model, or knowledge of anything connected with the national defense to which he is not entitled\u201d could be fined or imprisoned. After war broke out in Europe, President Woodrow Wilson appeared before Congress and asked it to strengthen the laws against sedition and the disclosure of information. His racist nativism on full display, he declared, \u201cThere are citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, born under other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of America\u201d who \u201chave sought to pry into every confidential transaction of the Government in order to serve interests alien to our own.\u201d The result was the Espionage Act of 1917\u2014a law that, with a few revisions, still forms the main legal basis for proscribing the unauthorized disclosure of national security information in the United States. The law was extraordinarily broad, criminalizing the disclosure of \u201cinformation respecting the national defence\u201d that could be \u201cused to the injury of the United States.\u201d\u00a0 Now there were rules criminalizing the disclosure of national security secrets. But what was a secret? Historians consider the American Expeditionary Forces\u2019 General Order No. 64, also issued in 1917, to be the first attempt by the U.S. government to adopt a formal classification system for government information that had national security value. In the years that followed, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy adopted their own regulations on classified information, producing a mishmash of classification rules across the military branches. Then, in 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt displaced this series of decentralized classification rules with an executive order making it unlawful to record \u201ccertain vital information about military or naval installations\u201d without permission. The rules applied to aircraft, weapons, and other military equipment, as well as to books, pamphlets, and other documents if they were classified as \u201csecret,\u201d \u201cconfidential,\u201d or \u201crestricted.\u201d\u00a0 Since then, many presidents have issued executive orders that define what information is classified, how it is classified, and who can access it. The latest comprehensive executive order, issued by President Barack Obama in 2009, lays out three levels of classification\u2014top secret, secret, and confidential\u2014along with a vast array of rules about what each level of classification means. Under the order, classified documents originate in two ways: one of the 1,867 officials designated as having \u201coriginal classification authority\u201d decides that a document should be classified or one of the four million or so individuals with access to classified material creates a new document using information that was already classified\u2014so-called derivative classification. In 2017, more than 49 million government-generated documents were derivatively classified. Almost everyone who has examined the U.S. system of keeping secrets has concluded that it results in mass overclassification. J. William Leonard, who led the Information Security Oversight Office during the Bush administration, once observed that more than half of the information that meets the criteria for classification \u201creally should not be classified.\u201d Others would put that number much higher. Michael Hayden, a former director of the National Security Agency and later of the CIA, once complained of receiving a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d email that carried a top-secret classification. One factor driving overclassification is the fact that those who do the classifying are almost always incentivized to err on the side of caution\u2014classifying up rather than down. When I worked at the Pentagon, if I made a mistake and classified a document or an email at too high a level, there would likely be no penalty. As far as I know, no one in the offices I worked with was ever disciplined for classifying a document too high. Classifying a document too low, however, can bring serious professional consequences\u2014not to mention potentially threaten U.S. national security. Secrecy, in other words, is the easiest and safest course of action. Secrecy also begets more secrecy, because documents must be classified at the highest level of classification of any information they contain. If a ten-page memo contains even a single sentence that is classified as top secret, for instance, the memo as a whole must be classified as top secret (unless it is \u201cportion marked,\u201d meaning that each segment\u2014the title, each paragraph, each bullet point, and each table, for instance\u2014is given a separate mark of classification). This requirement fuels an endless progression of derivative classification that compounds the United States\u2019 already enormous overclassification problem.\u00a0 The democratic costs of overclassification are hard to overstate. To note the obvious: a state cannot keep secrets from its enemies without also keeping them from its own population. Massive government secret keeping undermines democratic checks and balances, since it makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the public\u2014and, often, for members of Congress\u2014to know what the executive branch is up to.\u00a0 The U.S. government has done horrific things when acting in secret. CIA black sites, where detainees suspected of involvement in terrorist groups were tortured during the Bush administration, could not have survived public scrutiny\u2014which is why they operated in secret for years. Secrecy also undermines American democracy in more subtle ways. When the government keeps secrets, those secrets enable\u2014and sometimes require\u2014lies. When those lies are exposed, public trust in the government takes a hit\u2014as it did in 2013, when Edward Snowden, then a contractor for the National Security Agency, revealed the existence of a massive surveillance program under which the agency had accessed the email, instant-messaging, and cell phone data of millions of Americans. That revelation eroded trust in U.S. intelligence agencies, making it harder for them to operate\u2014precisely the opposite of what the government\u2019s secrecy was meant to achieve. Snowden speaking in Strasbourg, France, March 2019   Vincent Kessler / Reuters   Secrets also have a chilling effect on free speech. In May 2019, the Department of Justice indicted Julian Assange, the founder of the whistle-blowing organization WikiLeaks, on 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act for obtaining and publishing classified documents. It was the first time the government had brought such charges for publication alone, raising fears in the media that the government might start using the Espionage Act to prosecute journalists. As  The New York Times  reported at the time, Assange had been charged for actions that the paper itself had taken: it had obtained the same documents as WikiLeaks, also without government authorization, and published subsets of them, albeit with the names of informants withheld.\u00a0 And it is not just  whistleblowers  and journalists who need to worry; former government officials can also be caught in the classification vise. Even after leaving office, government employees are not only subject to potential criminal prosecution if they disclose classified information that they learned while in government but also required to submit their writings (and drafts of public talks) for \u201cprepublication review.\u201d John Bolton, who served as national security adviser to President Donald Trump, became an unexpected poster child for abuse of the prepublication review process after his book was subjected to delays that appeared politically motivated. He is far from alone. Millions of former government employees, including me, are bound by similar rules. The real harm of this system is not to former government employees, however. It is to the quality of public discourse, as former government employees with knowledge about the U.S. national security system too often decide that it is easier to simply stay silent. Overclassification also makes it difficult to keep the secrets that really matter. As the Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart put it in his concurring opinion in the 1971 case ordering the release of the Pentagon Papers, the Defense Department\u2019s classified history of the U.S. role in Vietnam, \u201cWhen everything is classified, then nothing is classified, and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical or the careless, and to be manipulated by those intent on self-protection or self-promotion.\u201d Too much secrecy can also make it harder to protect the American public from national security threats\u2014for instance, by limiting information sharing that could inform decision-making or identify new dangers. One reason the plot to carry out the 9/11 terrorist attacks was not detected in advance, the 9/11 Commission found, was too much secrecy: the failure to share information between agencies and with the public allowed the attackers to succeed. \u201cWe\u2019re better off with openness,\u201d said Thomas Kean, the chair of the commission. \u201cThe best ally we have in protecting ourselves against terrorism is an informed public.\u201d But perhaps the biggest cost of keeping too many secrets is that it has blinded the United States to an emerging and potentially even more dangerous threat: new tracking and monitoring technologies that are making it increasingly difficult to conceal even the most sensitive information. Take the exercise app Strava, which allows athletes to record their runs and bike rides, among other activities, and share them with friends. In 2017, this seemingly innocuous app became a national security nightmare after a student in Australia began posting images that showed the activities of American Strava users on what appeared to be forward operating bases in Afghanistan and military patrols in Syria. Others quickly generated maps of a French military base in Niger and of an Italian base and an undisclosed CIA site in Djibouti. Soon, it became clear that Strava data could be used not only to reveal the inner workings of such military installations but also, with a few tweaks, to identify and track particular individuals. Hundreds of similar apps track the locations of unwitting Americans every day, collecting information that is bought and sold by data aggregators. One such company, X-Mode, collects, aggregates, and resells location data so granular that it can track the movements of individual devices and even determine their hardware settings. X-Mode collects this information through its own applications, but it also pays app developers who use X-Mode\u2019s software developer and its location-tracking code for their data. According to a 2019 news report, X-Mode had access to location information for an average of 60 million global monthly users. In late 2020, Apple and Google banned X-Mode from collecting location information from mobile devices running their operating systems, but the tracking technology remains widespread. X-Mode is the best-known location-tracking data aggregator, but it is far from the only company taking advantage of publicly available information to track people\u2019s private lives. The New York\u2013based company Clearview AI has devised a groundbreaking facial recognition app that allows users to upload photos and run them against a database of more than three billion images scraped from Facebook, Venmo, YouTube, and millions of other websites to identify the people in the photos. Federal and state law enforcement agencies have found the app to be much better than the FBI\u2019s own database for tracking down criminal suspects. In 2019, the Indiana State Police solved a case in 20 minutes after uploading to Clearview an image from a cell phone video shot by a bystander to a crime. The man identified as the criminal suspect did not have a driver\u2019s license and was not in any government database, but someone (not the man himself) had posted a video of him on social media along with a caption containing his name. He was quickly arrested and charged.\u00a0 The rise of the Internet of Things\u2014networked devices\u2014means that more information is being collected about people\u2019s daily lives than ever before, including vast troves of voice data generated by voice-operated assistants such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa. In a 2017 report, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, identified the cybersecurity vulnerabilities produced by the Internet of Things as a key threat to national security. But the report focused narrowly on the physical dangers that sophisticated cybertools might pose to consumer products such as cars and medical devices and did not address the threats that these tools might pose to information security. Late last year, Congress enacted the Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act, which established minimum security requirements for connected devices. But the law applies only to devices sold to the federal government. Private citizens are  on their own . And devices are hardly the only way that companies collect personal information. Facebook makes third-party plug-ins, such as \u201clike\u201d and \u201cfollow\u201d buttons and tracking pixels, that its advertising partners can add to their own, non-Facebook websites and applications. These plug-ins, in addition to collecting data for Facebook partners, enable Facebook to monitor the online activities of its users even when they are not on its site.\u00a0 The spies that necessitated the Espionage Act a century ago have largely been replaced by this ubiquitous tracking and monitoring technology. If an app can expose the location and identity of U.S. soldiers on forward operating bases in Afghanistan, it can do the same to intelligence officers working at the CIA\u2019s headquarters, in Langley, Virginia, or even to the secretary of defense and his or her family members. Forget trying to place operatives under cover again. No matter how careful they have been to keep their identities off the Internet, their friends\u2019 photos of them on Facebook and Instagram and inescapable surveillance videos that data aggregators and their customers can easily access will make it nearly impossible to hide their true identities and contacts, much less the identities and whereabouts of their families and friends. The U.S. government may have refrained from sounding the alarm in part because its own intelligence agencies are exploiting such vulnerabilities themselves. Documents disclosed by WikiLeaks in 2017, for instance, revealed that the CIA had exploited a vulnerability in Samsung-connected televisions to use them as covert listening devices. But while the U.S. government has kept mum, private industry has met and sometimes surpassed authorities\u2019 ability to collect information. Nongovernmental organizations working in conflict zones now crowdsource conflict-related information that is often as good as or better than the information gathered by U.S. intelligence agencies. At the same time,  private satellite companies  provide on-demand access to sophisticated satellite imagery of practically any location on earth. In short, the government no longer has a monopoly on the information that matters.\u00a0 In the national security world, there is a concept known as \u201cthe mosaic theory.\u201d It holds that disparate, seemingly innocuous pieces of information can become significant when combined with other pieces of information. This theory is one reason why the vast majority of individuals with access to classified information are told that they cannot judge what information should be classified. A document that appears meaningless might, when put together with other information, give away an important piece of the mosaic to an adversary. Historically, intelligence analysts have pieced together bits of information to complete the mosaic. As specialists in their fields, good analysts come to know when a seemingly inconsequential piece of information may be significant in context. The advent of big data, combined with artificial intelligence, promises to upend this traditional approach. To understand why, consider the breakthrough made by the retail giant Target almost a decade ago. Like most companies, Target assigns its customers ID numbers tied to their in-store cards and to their credit cards, names, and email addresses. When a customer makes a purchase, that information is collected and aggregated. In 2012, a statistician working at Target figured out that he could use this information, together with purchase information from women who had set up baby registries, to determine who was likely pregnant. Women who were pregnant started buying unscented lotion, for instance, and they were more likely to purchase calcium, magnesium, and zinc supplements. Using this information, Target was able to create a \u201cpregnancy prediction score,\u201d calculate where women probably were in the course of their pregnancies, and send women coupons for products they may need. This technology only came to public attention after an angry customer complained to a manager at Target that the company was sending mailers to his daughter that clearly targeted pregnant women. Later, he called to apologize: \u201cIt turns out there\u2019s been some activities in my house I haven\u2019t been completely aware of. She\u2019s due in August. I owe you an apology.\u201d Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg testifying on Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C., October 2019   Erin Scott / Reuters   That was one company monitoring one set of purchases nearly a decade ago with the help of a simple statistical analysis. Now consider what an adversary could do if it combined that kind of information with similar information from a variety of databases and then used modern artificial intelligence to detect patterns. This is likely already happening. China is suspected of collecting the personal data of millions of Americans. William Evanina, former director of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center, warned in early 2021 that China had stolen personal information belonging to 80 percent of Americans, including by hacking health-care companies and smart home devices that connect to the Internet. In April, federal investigators concluded that Chinese hackers may have scraped information from social media sites such as LinkedIn to help them determine which email accounts belonged to system administrators, information that they then used to target Microsoft\u2019s email software with a cyberattack. In other words, China appears to have built a massive data set of Americans\u2019 private information using data illegally obtained and scraped from publicly available websites.\u00a0 In March 2014, Chinese hackers broke into computer networks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which houses personal information of all federal employees, and obtained the files of tens of thousands of employees who had applied for top-secret security clearances\u2014including me. Although these files were not classified, they contained valuable national security information: the identities of government employees with top-secret clearances, as well as their family contacts, overseas travel and international contacts, Social Security numbers, and contact information for neighbors and friends. Combined with the database of Americans\u2019 personal information, this information has likely put China in a position to determine which federal government employees with top-secret access are carrying large credit card debts, have used dating apps while married, have children studying abroad, or are staying unusually late at the office (possibly signaling that an important operation is underway). In short, while the U.S. government has been wasting its energy protecting classified information, the vast bulk of which is unimportant, information with much greater national security value has been left out for the taking. The current U.S. national security system was designed to protect twentieth-century secrets. At the time the system was created, most important national security information was in the government\u2019s hands. It made sense to design a system devoted almost entirely to keeping spies from obtaining that information and preventing insiders from disclosing it. Today, however, government information has been eclipsed by private information. The United States needs an approach to national security information that reflects that new reality. It must fundamentally reform the massive national security system that has created a giant edifice of mostly useless classified information and reduce the amount of private information that is easily attainable.\u00a0 In pursuit of the first aim, the United States should start by imposing an automatic ten-year declassification rule for all classified information. Currently, all classified records older than 25 years are supposed to be automatically declassified, but there are so many exceptions to that rule that many documents remain secret for a half century or more. It took until 2017 to declassify 2,800 classified records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, for instance, and even then the Trump administration held some records back. A ten-year declassification timeline should have only two exceptions: information classified as \u201crestricted data\u201d under the Atomic Energy Act and information identifying intelligence agency informants who are still alive. Decisions about whether declassifying any other information might harm national security should be left to an independent review board made up of former government officials, historians, journalists, and civil rights advocates. A government agency facing the automatic declassification of information it deemed potentially harmful could appeal to the board to extend the classification period\u2014in essence, forcing the agency to justify any deviation from the rule. By making declassification the default, such a rule would incentivize the government to adequately resource the review process and to allow it to take place in a timely manner.\u00a0 The government should also harness the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify cases of overclassification. Individual government employees who routinely overclassify information relative to their peers could be identified, notified that they classify documents more often than others, and encouraged to be more careful to assess the true need to classify. Artificial intelligence may also eventually be able to suggest classification levels at the time employees are writing documents or emails, to challenge incorrect classification decisions at the time they are made, and to review the classification of stored documents.\u00a0 Ending mass overclassification would free officials to think more creatively about addressing the emerging threat posed by enormous troves of readily available personal data. Washington can begin by following the lead of Beijing, which despite being an intrusive surveillance state recently enacted one of the strongest data privacy laws in the world\u2014likely not primarily to protect its citizens\u2019 privacy but to prevent their data from being collected and exploited by  foreign adversaries . The law applies to all entities and individuals, both inside and outside China, that process the personal data of Chinese citizens or organizations, imposing controls on the data and allowing Chinese citizens to sue if the information is stolen, misused, or corrupted. In so doing, the law discourages companies doing business in China from collecting and retaining personal data that could be of interest to foreign intelligence services. In other words, China is working to close the door to foreign powers seeking to exploit the personal data of its citizens, while the United States has left that door wide open.\u00a0 Privacy in the United States, meanwhile, relies on a patchwork of federal and state laws, each of which addresses elements of the problem, but none of which is comprehensive. For years, civil liberties groups have been calling on the federal government to protect the private information of individuals, but those calls have gone mostly unheeded. Today, however, it is increasingly clear that protecting the privacy of Americans is necessary not just to ensure their civil liberties but also to defend the country. Congress should start by expanding to all Internet-connected devices the same security requirements that currently apply only to those such devices that the government owns or operates. One subset of Internet-connected devices poses an especially acute danger: those that monitor the human body. These include fitness trackers that are worn on the body but also devices that are implanted or inserted into it: pacemakers, cardioverter defibrillators, and \u201cdigital pills\u201d with embedded sensors that record that the medication has been taken. To reduce the vulnerability of these devices to hacking, federal regulators must require manufacturers to improve their security protocols. The government should also give consumers new and better tools to control the data that companies collect about them. The Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act, introduced in March by Representative Suzan DelBene, Democrat of Washington, would require \u201copt in\u201d and \u201copt out\u201d consent and \u201cplain English privacy notices.\u201d These measures would certainly be improvements over the status quo. But research shows that consumers tend not to read disclosures, so even clear individual opt-in and opt-out requirements may not limit data collection from unwitting consumers. The proposed legislation would also preempt state laws that may be more protective than the federal law, meaning that it may actually reduce protections in some places. A better option would be for Congress to enact a federal law that follows the example recently set by California, requiring businesses to respect individuals\u2019 choices to universally opt out of data collection. That would be an important step toward giving control back to consumers. Last, Congress should create an independent federal agency to monitor and enforce data protection rules. The United States is one of only a few democracies that does not have an agency dedicated to data protection. Instead, it relies on the Federal Trade Commission, which has many competing obligations. The proposed Data Protection Act of 2021, introduced in June by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democratic of New York, would create an agency to \u201cregulate high-risk data practices and the collection, processing, and sharing of personal data\u201d\u2014in particular, by data aggregators. Establishing such an agency would also allow the federal government to develop expertise in data privacy issues and to respond more quickly and effectively to new challenges and threats.\u00a0 The inventor Charles Kettering once observed that \u201cwhen you lock the laboratory door, you lock out more than you lock in.\u201d In the early twentieth century, when the current classification system took shape, the information worth protecting was mostly located inside federal agencies, so locking the door made some sense. Today, however, Kettering\u2019s observation applies more than ever. Private entities have access to more, and in many cases better, information than the government, so locking the door only isolates federal agencies without protecting much information worth keeping secure.\u00a0 What a twenty-first-century approach to national security information requires is greater attention to privacy. Yet the United States has done little to protect the information about ordinary citizens that in a world of artificial intelligence and machine learning poses a  growing threat  to national security. The United States spends billions of dollars to protect classified information, much of which is already readily available from public sources. But it does little to enable its citizens, including those in important government positions, to keep their private lives from being documented, tracked, and exposed. In so doing, it is leaving pieces of the mosaic of U.S. national security lying around for its adversaries to gather up and put together. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

In 2017, the last year for which there are complete data, roughly four million Americans with security clearances classified around 50 million documents at a cost to U.S. taxpayers of around $18 billion.@@For a short time, I was one of those four million. From 2014 to 2015, I worked for the general counsel of the Department of Defense, a position for which I received a security clearance at the \u201ctop secret\u201d level. I came into the job thinking that all the classified documents I would see would include important national security secrets accessible only to those who had gone through an extensive background check and been placed in a position of trust. I was shocked to discover that much of what I read was in fact not all that different from what was available on the Internet. There were exceptions: events I learned about a few hours or even days before the rest of the world, for instance, and information that could be traced to intelligence sources. But the vast bulk of the classified material I saw was remarkable only for how unremarkable it was.@@The U.S. system for classifying secrets is based on the idea that the government has access to significant information that is not available, or at least not widely available, to private citizens or organizations. Over time, however, government intelligence sources have lost their advantage over private sources of intelligence. Thanks to new surveillance and monitoring technologies, including geolocation trackers, the Internet of Things, and commercial satellites, private information is now often better\u2014sometimes much better\u2014than the information held by governments.@@At the same time, these technologies have given rise to an altogether new threat: troves of personal data, many of them readily available, that can be exploited by @@. Each new piece of information, by itself, is relatively unimportant. But combined, the pieces can give foreign adversaries unprecedented insight into the personal lives of most Americans.@@Yet the United States has not begun to adapt its system for protecting information. It remains focused on keeping too many secrets that don\u2019t really matter, treating government information like the crown jewels while leaving private data almost entirely unguarded. This overemphasis on secrecy at the expense of privacy isn\u2019t just inefficient. It undermines American democracy and, increasingly, U.S. national security, as well.\u00a0@@The U.S. government did not always keep so many secrets. At the turn of the twentieth century, in fact, it had no formal nationwide system of secrecy. That began to change after Japan defeated Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, stunning Western countries and signaling the rise of a new regional power in Asia capable of challenging the major powers in Europe. Japan had long prohibited emigration, but it had lifted this restriction in 1886, just as its military prowess was beginning to grow. By 1908, around 150,000 Japanese immigrants had entered the United States.\u00a0@@As the number of new arrivals ticked up, American newspapers began reporting stories about \u201cJapanese spies roaming about the Philippines, Hawaii, and the continental United States, busily making drawings of the location of guns, mines, and other weapons of defense,\u201d as @@ put it in 1911. Journalists at @@ detailed a sophisticated Japanese spying operation in Los Angeles, Portland, and the harbors around Puget Sound, including rumors that \u201cagents of the Japanese War Office, in the guise of railroad section laborers or servants in families residing in the locality, are stationed at every large railroad bridge on the Pacific coast.\u201d These stories were fantastic\u2014and likely false, for the most part, as were widespread tales of Japanese candy store operators who were really mapmakers, Japanese fishermen who were really taking harbor soundings, and Japanese barbers who picked up military secrets from their unsuspecting clients.@@Members of Congress, alarmed by the stories, decided to act. The Defense Secrets Act, passed in 1911, was the first U.S. law to criminalize spying. It provided that \u201cwhoever, . . . without proper authority, obtains, takes, or makes, or attempts to obtain, take, or make, any document, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, plan, model, or knowledge of anything connected with the national defense to which he is not entitled\u201d could be fined or imprisoned.@@After war broke out in Europe, President Woodrow Wilson appeared before Congress and asked it to strengthen the laws against sedition and the disclosure of information. His racist nativism on full display, he declared, \u201cThere are citizens of the United States, I blush to admit, born under other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and opportunity of America\u201d who \u201chave sought to pry into every confidential transaction of the Government in order to serve interests alien to our own.\u201d The result was the Espionage Act of 1917\u2014a law that, with a few revisions, still forms the main legal basis for proscribing the unauthorized disclosure of national security information in the United States. The law was extraordinarily broad, criminalizing the disclosure of \u201cinformation respecting the national defence\u201d that could be \u201cused to the injury of the United States.\u201d\u00a0@@Now there were rules criminalizing the disclosure of national security secrets. But what was a secret? Historians consider the American Expeditionary Forces\u2019 General Order No. 64, also issued in 1917, to be the first attempt by the U.S. government to adopt a formal classification system for government information that had national security value. In the years that followed, the U.S. Army and the U.S. Navy adopted their own regulations on classified information, producing a mishmash of classification rules across the military branches. Then, in 1940, President Franklin Roosevelt displaced this series of decentralized classification rules with an executive order making it unlawful to record \u201ccertain vital information about military or naval installations\u201d without permission. The rules applied to aircraft, weapons, and other military equipment, as well as to books, pamphlets, and other documents if they were classified as \u201csecret,\u201d \u201cconfidential,\u201d or \u201crestricted.\u201d\u00a0@@Since then, many presidents have issued executive orders that define what information is classified, how it is classified, and who can access it. The latest comprehensive executive order, issued by President Barack Obama in 2009, lays out three levels of classification\u2014top secret, secret, and confidential\u2014along with a vast array of rules about what each level of classification means. Under the order, classified documents originate in two ways: one of the 1,867 officials designated as having \u201coriginal classification authority\u201d decides that a document should be classified or one of the four million or so individuals with access to classified material creates a new document using information that was already classified\u2014so-called derivative classification. In 2017, more than 49 million government-generated documents were derivatively classified.@@Almost everyone who has examined the U.S. system of keeping secrets has concluded that it results in mass overclassification. J. William Leonard, who led the Information Security Oversight Office during the Bush administration, once observed that more than half of the information that meets the criteria for classification \u201creally should not be classified.\u201d Others would put that number much higher. Michael Hayden, a former director of the National Security Agency and later of the CIA, once complained of receiving a \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d email that carried a top-secret classification.@@One factor driving overclassification is the fact that those who do the classifying are almost always incentivized to err on the side of caution\u2014classifying up rather than down. When I worked at the Pentagon, if I made a mistake and classified a document or an email at too high a level, there would likely be no penalty. As far as I know, no one in the offices I worked with was ever disciplined for classifying a document too high. Classifying a document too low, however, can bring serious professional consequences\u2014not to mention potentially threaten U.S. national security. Secrecy, in other words, is the easiest and safest course of action.@@Secrecy also begets more secrecy, because documents must be classified at the highest level of classification of any information they contain. If a ten-page memo contains even a single sentence that is classified as top secret, for instance, the memo as a whole must be classified as top secret (unless it is \u201cportion marked,\u201d meaning that each segment\u2014the title, each paragraph, each bullet point, and each table, for instance\u2014is given a separate mark of classification). This requirement fuels an endless progression of derivative classification that compounds the United States\u2019 already enormous overclassification problem.\u00a0@@The democratic costs of overclassification are hard to overstate. To note the obvious: a state cannot keep secrets from its enemies without also keeping them from its own population. Massive government secret keeping undermines democratic checks and balances, since it makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the public\u2014and, often, for members of Congress\u2014to know what the executive branch is up to.\u00a0@@The U.S. government has done horrific things when acting in secret. CIA black sites, where detainees suspected of involvement in terrorist groups were tortured during the Bush administration, could not have survived public scrutiny\u2014which is why they operated in secret for years. Secrecy also undermines American democracy in more subtle ways. When the government keeps secrets, those secrets enable\u2014and sometimes require\u2014lies. When those lies are exposed, public trust in the government takes a hit\u2014as it did in 2013, when Edward Snowden, then a contractor for the National Security Agency, revealed the existence of a massive surveillance program under which the agency had accessed the email, instant-messaging, and cell phone data of millions of Americans. That revelation eroded trust in U.S. intelligence agencies, making it harder for them to operate\u2014precisely the opposite of what the government\u2019s secrecy was meant to achieve.@@Secrets also have a chilling effect on free speech. In May 2019, the Department of Justice indicted Julian Assange, the founder of the whistle-blowing organization WikiLeaks, on 17 counts of violating the Espionage Act for obtaining and publishing classified documents. It was the first time the government had brought such charges for publication alone, raising fears in the media that the government might start using the Espionage Act to prosecute journalists. As @@ reported at the time, Assange had been charged for actions that the paper itself had taken: it had obtained the same documents as WikiLeaks, also without government authorization, and published subsets of them, albeit with the names of informants withheld.\u00a0@@And it is not just @@ and journalists who need to worry; former government officials can also be caught in the classification vise. Even after leaving office, government employees are not only subject to potential criminal prosecution if they disclose classified information that they learned while in government but also required to submit their writings (and drafts of public talks) for \u201cprepublication review.\u201d John Bolton, who served as national security adviser to President Donald Trump, became an unexpected poster child for abuse of the prepublication review process after his book was subjected to delays that appeared politically motivated. He is far from alone. Millions of former government employees, including me, are bound by similar rules. The real harm of this system is not to former government employees, however. It is to the quality of public discourse, as former government employees with knowledge about the U.S. national security system too often decide that it is easier to simply stay silent.@@Overclassification also makes it difficult to keep the secrets that really matter. As the Supreme Court justice Potter Stewart put it in his concurring opinion in the 1971 case ordering the release of the Pentagon Papers, the Defense Department\u2019s classified history of the U.S. role in Vietnam, \u201cWhen everything is classified, then nothing is classified, and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical or the careless, and to be manipulated by those intent on self-protection or self-promotion.\u201d Too much secrecy can also make it harder to protect the American public from national security threats\u2014for instance, by limiting information sharing that could inform decision-making or identify new dangers. One reason the plot to carry out the 9/11 terrorist attacks was not detected in advance, the 9/11 Commission found, was too much secrecy: the failure to share information between agencies and with the public allowed the attackers to succeed. \u201cWe\u2019re better off with openness,\u201d said Thomas Kean, the chair of the commission. \u201cThe best ally we have in protecting ourselves against terrorism is an informed public.\u201d@@But perhaps the biggest cost of keeping too many secrets is that it has blinded the United States to an emerging and potentially even more dangerous threat: new tracking and monitoring technologies that are making it increasingly difficult to conceal even the most sensitive information. Take the exercise app Strava, which allows athletes to record their runs and bike rides, among other activities, and share them with friends. In 2017, this seemingly innocuous app became a national security nightmare after a student in Australia began posting images that showed the activities of American Strava users on what appeared to be forward operating bases in Afghanistan and military patrols in Syria. Others quickly generated maps of a French military base in Niger and of an Italian base and an undisclosed CIA site in Djibouti. Soon, it became clear that Strava data could be used not only to reveal the inner workings of such military installations but also, with a few tweaks, to identify and track particular individuals.@@Hundreds of similar apps track the locations of unwitting Americans every day, collecting information that is bought and sold by data aggregators. One such company, X-Mode, collects, aggregates, and resells location data so granular that it can track the movements of individual devices and even determine their hardware settings. X-Mode collects this information through its own applications, but it also pays app developers who use X-Mode\u2019s software developer and its location-tracking code for their data. According to a 2019 news report, X-Mode had access to location information for an average of 60 million global monthly users. In late 2020, Apple and Google banned X-Mode from collecting location information from mobile devices running their operating systems, but the tracking technology remains widespread.@@X-Mode is the best-known location-tracking data aggregator, but it is far from the only company taking advantage of publicly available information to track people\u2019s private lives. The New York\u2013based company Clearview AI has devised a groundbreaking facial recognition app that allows users to upload photos and run them against a database of more than three billion images scraped from Facebook, Venmo, YouTube, and millions of other websites to identify the people in the photos. Federal and state law enforcement agencies have found the app to be much better than the FBI\u2019s own database for tracking down criminal suspects. In 2019, the Indiana State Police solved a case in 20 minutes after uploading to Clearview an image from a cell phone video shot by a bystander to a crime. The man identified as the criminal suspect did not have a driver\u2019s license and was not in any government database, but someone (not the man himself) had posted a video of him on social media along with a caption containing his name. He was quickly arrested and charged.\u00a0@@The rise of the Internet of Things\u2014networked devices\u2014means that more information is being collected about people\u2019s daily lives than ever before, including vast troves of voice data generated by voice-operated assistants such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa. In a 2017 report, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, identified the cybersecurity vulnerabilities produced by the Internet of Things as a key threat to national security. But the report focused narrowly on the physical dangers that sophisticated cybertools might pose to consumer products such as cars and medical devices and did not address the threats that these tools might pose to information security. Late last year, Congress enacted the Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act, which established minimum security requirements for connected devices. But the law applies only to devices sold to the federal government. Private citizens are @@. And devices are hardly the only way that companies collect personal information. Facebook makes third-party plug-ins, such as \u201clike\u201d and \u201cfollow\u201d buttons and tracking pixels, that its advertising partners can add to their own, non-Facebook websites and applications. These plug-ins, in addition to collecting data for Facebook partners, enable Facebook to monitor the online activities of its users even when they are not on its site.\u00a0@@The spies that necessitated the Espionage Act a century ago have largely been replaced by this ubiquitous tracking and monitoring technology. If an app can expose the location and identity of U.S. soldiers on forward operating bases in Afghanistan, it can do the same to intelligence officers working at the CIA\u2019s headquarters, in Langley, Virginia, or even to the secretary of defense and his or her family members. Forget trying to place operatives under cover again. No matter how careful they have been to keep their identities off the Internet, their friends\u2019 photos of them on Facebook and Instagram and inescapable surveillance videos that data aggregators and their customers can easily access will make it nearly impossible to hide their true identities and contacts, much less the identities and whereabouts of their families and friends.@@The U.S. government may have refrained from sounding the alarm in part because its own intelligence agencies are exploiting such vulnerabilities themselves. Documents disclosed by WikiLeaks in 2017, for instance, revealed that the CIA had exploited a vulnerability in Samsung-connected televisions to use them as covert listening devices. But while the U.S. government has kept mum, private industry has met and sometimes surpassed authorities\u2019 ability to collect information. Nongovernmental organizations working in conflict zones now crowdsource conflict-related information that is often as good as or better than the information gathered by U.S. intelligence agencies. At the same time, @@ provide on-demand access to sophisticated satellite imagery of practically any location on earth. In short, the government no longer has a monopoly on the information that matters.\u00a0@@In the national security world, there is a concept known as \u201cthe mosaic theory.\u201d It holds that disparate, seemingly innocuous pieces of information can become significant when combined with other pieces of information. This theory is one reason why the vast majority of individuals with access to classified information are told that they cannot judge what information should be classified. A document that appears meaningless might, when put together with other information, give away an important piece of the mosaic to an adversary.@@Historically, intelligence analysts have pieced together bits of information to complete the mosaic. As specialists in their fields, good analysts come to know when a seemingly inconsequential piece of information may be significant in context. The advent of big data, combined with artificial intelligence, promises to upend this traditional approach. To understand why, consider the breakthrough made by the retail giant Target almost a decade ago. Like most companies, Target assigns its customers ID numbers tied to their in-store cards and to their credit cards, names, and email addresses. When a customer makes a purchase, that information is collected and aggregated. In 2012, a statistician working at Target figured out that he could use this information, together with purchase information from women who had set up baby registries, to determine who was likely pregnant. Women who were pregnant started buying unscented lotion, for instance, and they were more likely to purchase calcium, magnesium, and zinc supplements. Using this information, Target was able to create a \u201cpregnancy prediction score,\u201d calculate where women probably were in the course of their pregnancies, and send women coupons for products they may need. This technology only came to public attention after an angry customer complained to a manager at Target that the company was sending mailers to his daughter that clearly targeted pregnant women. Later, he called to apologize: \u201cIt turns out there\u2019s been some activities in my house I haven\u2019t been completely aware of. She\u2019s due in August. I owe you an apology.\u201d@@That was one company monitoring one set of purchases nearly a decade ago with the help of a simple statistical analysis. Now consider what an adversary could do if it combined that kind of information with similar information from a variety of databases and then used modern artificial intelligence to detect patterns.@@This is likely already happening. China is suspected of collecting the personal data of millions of Americans. William Evanina, former director of the U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Center, warned in early 2021 that China had stolen personal information belonging to 80 percent of Americans, including by hacking health-care companies and smart home devices that connect to the Internet. In April, federal investigators concluded that Chinese hackers may have scraped information from social media sites such as LinkedIn to help them determine which email accounts belonged to system administrators, information that they then used to target Microsoft\u2019s email software with a cyberattack. In other words, China appears to have built a massive data set of Americans\u2019 private information using data illegally obtained and scraped from publicly available websites.\u00a0@@In March 2014, Chinese hackers broke into computer networks of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which houses personal information of all federal employees, and obtained the files of tens of thousands of employees who had applied for top-secret security clearances\u2014including me. Although these files were not classified, they contained valuable national security information: the identities of government employees with top-secret clearances, as well as their family contacts, overseas travel and international contacts, Social Security numbers, and contact information for neighbors and friends. Combined with the database of Americans\u2019 personal information, this information has likely put China in a position to determine which federal government employees with top-secret access are carrying large credit card debts, have used dating apps while married, have children studying abroad, or are staying unusually late at the office (possibly signaling that an important operation is underway). In short, while the U.S. government has been wasting its energy protecting classified information, the vast bulk of which is unimportant, information with much greater national security value has been left out for the taking.@@The current U.S. national security system was designed to protect twentieth-century secrets. At the time the system was created, most important national security information was in the government\u2019s hands. It made sense to design a system devoted almost entirely to keeping spies from obtaining that information and preventing insiders from disclosing it. Today, however, government information has been eclipsed by private information. The United States needs an approach to national security information that reflects that new reality. It must fundamentally reform the massive national security system that has created a giant edifice of mostly useless classified information and reduce the amount of private information that is easily attainable.\u00a0@@In pursuit of the first aim, the United States should start by imposing an automatic ten-year declassification rule for all classified information. Currently, all classified records older than 25 years are supposed to be automatically declassified, but there are so many exceptions to that rule that many documents remain secret for a half century or more. It took until 2017 to declassify 2,800 classified records relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, for instance, and even then the Trump administration held some records back.@@A ten-year declassification timeline should have only two exceptions: information classified as \u201crestricted data\u201d under the Atomic Energy Act and information identifying intelligence agency informants who are still alive. Decisions about whether declassifying any other information might harm national security should be left to an independent review board made up of former government officials, historians, journalists, and civil rights advocates. A government agency facing the automatic declassification of information it deemed potentially harmful could appeal to the board to extend the classification period\u2014in essence, forcing the agency to justify any deviation from the rule. By making declassification the default, such a rule would incentivize the government to adequately resource the review process and to allow it to take place in a timely manner.\u00a0@@The government should also harness the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify cases of overclassification. Individual government employees who routinely overclassify information relative to their peers could be identified, notified that they classify documents more often than others, and encouraged to be more careful to assess the true need to classify. Artificial intelligence may also eventually be able to suggest classification levels at the time employees are writing documents or emails, to challenge incorrect classification decisions at the time they are made, and to review the classification of stored documents.\u00a0@@Ending mass overclassification would free officials to think more creatively about addressing the emerging threat posed by enormous troves of readily available personal data. Washington can begin by following the lead of Beijing, which despite being an intrusive surveillance state recently enacted one of the strongest data privacy laws in the world\u2014likely not primarily to protect its citizens\u2019 privacy but to prevent their data from being collected and exploited by @@. The law applies to all entities and individuals, both inside and outside China, that process the personal data of Chinese citizens or organizations, imposing controls on the data and allowing Chinese citizens to sue if the information is stolen, misused, or corrupted. In so doing, the law discourages companies doing business in China from collecting and retaining personal data that could be of interest to foreign intelligence services. In other words, China is working to close the door to foreign powers seeking to exploit the personal data of its citizens, while the United States has left that door wide open.\u00a0@@Privacy in the United States, meanwhile, relies on a patchwork of federal and state laws, each of which addresses elements of the problem, but none of which is comprehensive. For years, civil liberties groups have been calling on the federal government to protect the private information of individuals, but those calls have gone mostly unheeded. Today, however, it is increasingly clear that protecting the privacy of Americans is necessary not just to ensure their civil liberties but also to defend the country.@@Congress should start by expanding to all Internet-connected devices the same security requirements that currently apply only to those such devices that the government owns or operates. One subset of Internet-connected devices poses an especially acute danger: those that monitor the human body. These include fitness trackers that are worn on the body but also devices that are implanted or inserted into it: pacemakers, cardioverter defibrillators, and \u201cdigital pills\u201d with embedded sensors that record that the medication has been taken. To reduce the vulnerability of these devices to hacking, federal regulators must require manufacturers to improve their security protocols.@@The government should also give consumers new and better tools to control the data that companies collect about them. The Information Transparency and Personal Data Control Act, introduced in March by Representative Suzan DelBene, Democrat of Washington, would require \u201copt in\u201d and \u201copt out\u201d consent and \u201cplain English privacy notices.\u201d These measures would certainly be improvements over the status quo. But research shows that consumers tend not to read disclosures, so even clear individual opt-in and opt-out requirements may not limit data collection from unwitting consumers. The proposed legislation would also preempt state laws that may be more protective than the federal law, meaning that it may actually reduce protections in some places. A better option would be for Congress to enact a federal law that follows the example recently set by California, requiring businesses to respect individuals\u2019 choices to universally opt out of data collection. That would be an important step toward giving control back to consumers.@@Last, Congress should create an independent federal agency to monitor and enforce data protection rules. The United States is one of only a few democracies that does not have an agency dedicated to data protection. Instead, it relies on the Federal Trade Commission, which has many competing obligations. The proposed Data Protection Act of 2021, introduced in June by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Democratic of New York, would create an agency to \u201cregulate high-risk data practices and the collection, processing, and sharing of personal data\u201d\u2014in particular, by data aggregators. Establishing such an agency would also allow the federal government to develop expertise in data privacy issues and to respond more quickly and effectively to new challenges and threats.\u00a0@@The inventor Charles Kettering once observed that \u201cwhen you lock the laboratory door, you lock out more than you lock in.\u201d In the early twentieth century, when the current classification system took shape, the information worth protecting was mostly located inside federal agencies, so locking the door made some sense. Today, however, Kettering\u2019s observation applies more than ever. Private entities have access to more, and in many cases better, information than the government, so locking the door only isolates federal agencies without protecting much information worth keeping secure.\u00a0@@What a twenty-first-century approach to national security information requires is greater attention to privacy. Yet the United States has done little to protect the information about ordinary citizens that in a world of artificial intelligence and machine learning poses a @@ to national security. The United States spends billions of dollars to protect classified information, much of which is already readily available from public sources. But it does little to enable its citizens, including those in important government positions, to keep their private lives from being documented, tracked, and exposed. In so doing, it is leaving pieces of the mosaic of U.S. national security lying around for its adversaries to gather up and put together.", "download_timeout": 180.0, "download_slot":

Permissions One month into the Ukraine war, a broad consensus has formed among American commentators about why Russia has failed to achieve its goals. Trapped in an emotional and ideological bubble, the argument runs, Russian President Vladimir Putin made several basic strategic blunders. He convinced himself the war would be quick and easy, that foreign troops would be welcomed as liberators, that he could shock or crush any resistance, and that he would be able install a friendly local government to protect his interests once the fighting stopped. Soon after the invasion began, however, these fantasies ran into reality. Ukrainian forces stood up and Russian forces bogged down. And now an angry, wounded bear is stuck in a quagmire, lashing out in frustration instead of rationally reversing course. The analysis appears sound, but the irony is rich\u2014for the description of Putin\u2019s mistakes is a decent summary of not just the earlier Soviet experience in Afghanistan but also much of U.S. national security policy over the last several decades, including the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Washington has repeatedly launched military interventions with extravagantly unrealistic expectations, overestimated its own capabilities and underestimated its opponents, believed it would be loved rather than hated, and thought it could put its favorites into office and then get away easily. And time and again, after running up against the same harsh realities as Putin, it has tried to bull its way forward before ultimately deciding to reverse course and withdraw. Yes, American motives were nobler. Yes, American methods were less brutal (most of the time). Yes, there were many other differences between the conflicts. But on a strategic level, the broad similarities are striking. This means there are several important lessons to be learned from recent American military history\u2014but only if that history is looked at from the enemy\u2019s perspective, not Washington\u2019s. Because it was the enemies who won. ROLE REVERSAL The United States is used to thinking of itself as the alpha military power, attacking and conquering and controlling the action. In the Ukraine war, however, it\u2019s on the  other side , trying to stymie and counterpunch and wear down the alpha until exhaustion sets in. Playing defense is easier and cheaper than playing offense, but it takes more time and requires a different mindset. In this context, the United States\u2019 failure to conquer several countries recently is helpful. Washington can just switch playbooks and use the strategies and tactics that gave it the most trouble. Among other things, that means winning ugly: planting endless improvised explosive devices, neutralizing collaborators, and frustrating not just the invasion but any hopes of stable occupation. If Washington should think of the Ukrainians as playing the part of Vietnamese communists, the Taliban, and Iraqi militias, then it should also recognize that Moscow is now starring in Washington\u2019s old role. This parallel should make it easier for American policymakers to empathize and approach negotiations sensibly. The war might be existential for Ukraine, but it\u2019s optional for Russia. Putin did indeed miscalculate and now finds himself in a nasty place with few good options\u2014just like the United States eventually did in Vietnam,  Afghanistan , and Iraq. Defeat or stalemate on the battlefield is a necessary condition for Russian withdrawal, but as Americans have learned, it can take a long time for a great power to go through the stages of grief and accept such an outcome. And humiliation makes exit harder to stomach, not easier. So instead of cutting off ties and publicly rubbing Moscow\u2019s nose in its troubles\u2014let alone fantasizing about  regime change \u2014Washington should maintain contact and allow others to propose face-saving exit strategies that allow Putin to backtrack while preserving as much dignity as possible. YOU TALKING TO ME?  At the start of the war, many questioned Putin\u2019s sanity. Now it seems he was just given to wishful thinking\u2014about everything. Here again, experience should help U.S. policymakers empathize and remain vigilant about falling into the same trap themselves yet again, in Ukraine or anywhere else.  In April 2003, for example, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice succinctly captured the George W. Bush administration\u2019s take on postwar Iraq: \u201cWe fundamentally believe that when the grip of terror that Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime has wreaked on its own people is finally broken and Iraqis have an opportunity to build a better future, that you are going to see people who want to build a better future\u2014not blow it up.\u201d Civilian leaders in the Pentagon, meanwhile, convinced themselves that their special military operation could be wrapped up quickly and cheaply. \u201cThe idea that it would take several hundred thousand U.S. forces I think is far off the mark,\u201d testified Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld a few weeks before the invasion. \u201cTo assume we\u2019re going to pay for it all is just wrong,\u201d Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz chimed in.  One of the fascinating and refreshing aspects of the Ukraine war is the way the Biden administration has weaponized truth, releasing accurate intelligence and garnering the U.S. government a strange new respect for its honesty. When Washington was in the role of attacker, things were a bit different. Official briefings on Vietnam,  Afghanistan , and Iraq invariably portrayed things as going well, with victory always just around the corner\u2014up until the day the helicopters came to lift people off the roof. It would be nice if the turn toward official American credibility were to stick, because there could hardly be a better or cheaper way to win friends and influence people around the globe. One can always hope. BEEN THERE, DONE THAT A shocking aspect of the Ukraine war, everybody agrees, is how stupid it is. What kind of idiot invades a country without a plan for how it all ends? This lesson might be the cringiest of all for Washington to learn, however, because entering wars without plans for ending them is an American national pastime.  The original war termination plans for Vietnam amounted to \u201cpound the enemy harder and hope he gives up.\u201d In the Gulf War, the plan for postwar Iraq amounted to \u201chope Saddam is toppled in a military coup.\u201d Postwar planning for the invasion of Iraq was so risible it occasioned then-Major General David Petraeus\u2019s now-famous lament: \u201cTell me how this ends.\u201d  A shocking aspect of the Ukraine war, everybody agrees, is how stupid it is. This problem, at least, has a simple solution\u2014begin war planning with a plausible vision of a stable postwar situation and reverse engineer a strategy to get there. Make the war\u2019s end your intellectual starting point, in other words, so there\u2019s no way you can avoid thinking about it or having it drive everything else. In 2003, the Bush administration considered postwar Iraq to be \u201cPhase IV\u201d of the conflict. Is anybody surprised its harried policymakers never got to the fourth item on their to-do list? A final lesson is one Americans used to understand well, having won an anticolonial war themselves back in the day: don\u2019t bet against  nationalism . People fighting foreigners on their own turf are highly motivated, as the impassioned Ukrainian defenders holding off lackluster Russian attackers have shown yet again. Whatever the war\u2019s endgame, it will not yield a loyal new province for Moscow.  The great military theorist Carl von Clausewitz noted, \u201cThe maximum use of force is in no way incompatible with the simultaneous use of the intellect.\u201d It might not be incompatible, but in practice, the combination is pretty rare. The biggest takeaway from all these cases is simple. If you can\u2019t tell a persuasive story about how a war is going to end well, don\u2019t begin it in the first place.

viewed the United States as one of the countries best positioned to handle an infectious disease outbreak. The  2019 Global Health Security Index , which benchmarks each nation\u2019s health security preparedness, ranked the United States the number one country out of 195. Now, as the world enters the third year of COVID-19, it is clear the United States was in fact ill-prepared for a real pandemic.  The number of Americans reported to have died from COVID-19 is  63 percent  higher than any other high-income country. The U.S.  death rate  stands at 295 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 245 per 100,000 in the United Kingdom, 152 per 100,000 in Germany, and 99 per 100,000 in Canada. There are many reasons for the faltering U.S. response, which will be dissected in detail over the coming years. They range from communication challenges, which have fueled an avalanche of misinformation, to a vaccine campaign that trails behind Australia, Canada, and many European countries. The fragmented public health infrastructure in the United States wasn\u2019t built or resourced to withstand or respond to large-scale public health emergencies. And then there are the challenges with the U.S. health care system itself, problems that existed long before COVID showed up: access to care, health inequities, and the underlying health conditions of Americans.  If one surveys the world to see how different countries responded to the multiple waves of COVID-19 over these last two years, there are some practices that shine brighter than the rest. No one country has had a perfect pandemic response. China\u2019s zero-COVID policy, for example, has resulted in low morbidity and mortality rates for the first two years of the pandemic, but it has come at a hefty price. It involves social isolation, a continuous cycle of lockdowns, and curtailment of individual freedoms. And now, with the highly contagious Omicron variant\u2014and all its sublineages, including the more transmissible BA.2 variant\u2014it looks highly unlikely that this strategy will continue to work. Other regions that successfully mitigated the virus throughout the first two years are now dealing with large case counts and increasing deaths, such as in South Korea and Hong Kong. Although the United States can learn a great deal from COVID responses around the world, it should focus on a few important measures that would be politically and legally possible for it to carry out, including addressing misinformation and doing better on science communication, fostering  trust  in government, and improving the U.S. public health data infrastructure, to name a few.  SWABS AND SHOTS For most of the pandemic, the United States was not doing enough testing. But with the expansion of manufacturing and the increased distribution of rapid antigen tests, U.S. officials can now credibly claim that anyone who wants a test can get one. That wasn\u2019t the case in November, as the Omicron variant was taking off in the United States and demand soared. That demand has since tapered off, contributing to the abundance of tests now available. Ubiquitous testing, however, was available in most of Europe much earlier, and often at minimal or no cost. The value of rapid testing as a public health tool was recognized much earlier in many European and Asian countries. It was used to identify infected people, cut down on chains of transmission, and reduce quarantine periods for international travelers. This framework for testing, along with removing barriers such as cost and access, made rapid antigen testing as routine as brushing one\u2019s teeth in places such as in Germany, Slovakia, and the United Kingdom. This culture of frequent testing allowed COVID-positive people to quickly limit their exposure to others. If the United States had incorporated frequent rapid antigen testing earlier in the pandemic, and had enabled a faster regulatory approval process for new tests, it may have been able to avert some of the nearly 80 million confirmed  COVID-19  cases\u2014which, in turn, would have prevented some of the 969,000 U.S. COVID deaths.  Now, the issue is no longer availability or supply, it\u2019s whether the United States can maintain testing capacity with ongoing funding levels\u2014money that is now on the chopping block in Congress. With vaccines, the United States has been ahead of the rest of the world in terms of supply. But even with three safe and effective COVID-19  vaccines , millions of eligible Americans remain unvaccinated. As of March 21, approximately 18 percent of the population had not yet received a single dose. The vaccination campaign has been riddled with challenges: vaccine hesitancy, misinformation and disinformation, the  politicization  of public health, and widespread anti-science attitudes. With 65 percent of the population fully vaccinated, and only 29 percent who are up to date with boosters, the United States  ranks  in 65th and 70th   place in the world. The United Arab Emirates is 98 percent vaccinated and 50 percent boosted; Portugal is 92 percent and 61 percent; and Canada is 83 percent and 48 percent.  Beyond access barriers, such as time off to get vaccinated or having to travel to get a dose, a main reason the United States is trailing behind in vaccination rates is low trust in the government, as well as lack of community cohesion. A recent  exploratory analysis  by the COVID-19 National Preparedness Collaborators showed the importance and effect of trust in government and trust in communities, which correlated with high COVID-19 vaccine coverage among middle- and high-income countries. Effectively communicating evolving knowledge about an emerging infectious disease in a way that informs, inspires trust in government, and enables the public to take necessary steps to protect families and communities has become one of the most complicated and difficult aspects of pandemic response. Every country has struggled with this, though some started with stronger trust in government. Other countries benefited from their previous experiences with viral outbreaks. Understanding the danger posed by  COVID  made them more willing to take rapid action. What has been clear is that honest, regular communication with the public by trusted messengers has been critical. New Zealand and Germany have been particularly successful in their efforts to provide their publics with reliable information grounded in science. With a crisis communication style rooted in empathy, honesty, and openness, the messenger and the message were well received. But as important as this has been, crisis communication remains understudied and few public health officials are sufficiently trained in it, particularly in how to counter disinformation. Prioritizing communication must become a priority for all countries and should be integral to advanced training in every scientific, medical, and public health discipline. INFORMATION WARS One of the biggest shortfalls of the U.S. pandemic response has been relying on other countries\u2019 clinical and epidemiological data to make localized public health policy decisions, such as who should receive a booster dose. Vaccination data on booster demand from Israel, for example, has been leading the way as a test case for the United States. The lack of standardized data collection and real-time reporting and interpretation in the United States represents one of the country\u2019s gravest pandemic deficiencies, and it was known about for decades. Former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  wrote  earlier this month that \u201cfor too long, we have neglected our nation\u2019s public health data infrastructure, much of which is aging, obsolete and insufficient to meet our needs \u2026 Progress was limited because of both lack of funds and lack of legal authority.\u201d The different ways in which public health agencies collect and store data combined with  privatized health care creates challenges for integrating clinical and epidemiological data. Many public health and health-care systems are not connected, and there is limited interoperability   for sharing critical data .  In contrast, countries with nationalized health care, such as the United Kingdom, benefited greatly from their standardized procedures and their ability to conduct large-scale clinical trials. Other countries, including Denmark, Israel , and  South Korea  have also been the frontrunners in sophisticated surveillance systems and real-time reporting. Efforts are underway in the United States to think about how to address this challenge, such as incentivizing and improving data sharing, and devising new strategies for large-scale clinical trials.  Keeping up with the  virus  as it evolves has been a challenge for the United States. Mike Ryan, executive director of the Health Emergencies Programme at the World Health Organization, said it best: \u201cSpeed trumps perfection. Perfection is the enemy of good when it comes to emergency responses.\u201d The United States has often been too late to implement policy measures, including non-pharmaceutical interventions like mask mandates. For example, the initial federal mask mandate for public transportation went into effect in February 2021, shortly after the Biden administration took office, a full year into the pandemic. It has also been slow to facilitate key pandemic products, for example the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s sluggish authorization of rapid at-home tests and its late acknowledgement of their utility as a public health tool. At the same time, the United States has been quick to scale back other measures, like lifting mask ordinances   in certain states   or reducing surveillance testing .  The United States\u2019 bottom-up approach has led an uncoordinated, uncollaborative response, no matter the federal government\u2019s efforts to provide guidance. Instead, the United States has 50 epidemics\u2014a different one in each state.  Places that implemented rapid responses to COVID-19, such as Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong, have prior experience dealing with pandemic threats, such as SARS 20 years ago and the continued threat of avian influenza. This prior outbreak experience built muscle memory about what to do when a pandemic hits and enabled these countries to start with a robust level of trust from the population. One can only hope the United States\u2019 experience with COVID-19 will similarly lead to better instincts the next time it faces an infectious disease threat. THE NEXT CHAPTER And now, the United States enters the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, experiencing the equivalent of a mass casualty event every day from COVID-19. Even though many consider this current period a lull, more than 1,000 deaths are still being reported each day. Now is the time to prepare for future surges and to stay ahead of this virus. The Biden administration\u2019s COVID-19 preparedness plan does just that by focusing on four main goals: protect against and treat COVID-19, prepare for variants, prevent economic and educational shutdowns, and continue to vaccinate the world. As promising as this national plan is, funding for it was stripped from the U.S. government\u2019s spending package, and a standalone, supplemental bill is not certain to pass. The consequences of congressional inaction for the American public could be severe. There is much work to be done in the United States, including revolutionizing and investing in public health infrastructure, bridging data integration from disparate health care systems, and changing the country\u2019s reactive approach. The changes needed are daunting. It will require reestablishing a collective sense of community and a restoration of trust in the government. It will also require a renewed commitment to public health and the health care workforce, which is still reeling from two years on nonstop emergency response with morale at an all-time low. All of this will require political leadership and resources. The United States\u2019 bubble gum and Band-Aid approach to pandemics needs to end with this one.

Some, such as Germany, have boosted their military spending after years of riding on American coattails. In these actions, certain analysts have found a silver lining to the devastation of the war in Ukraine. Writing in  Foreign Affairs  in March, Michael Beckley and Hal Brands  argued  that the international reaction to the invasion would reverberate well beyond the current crisis. The concerted response to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s actions could \u201cconsolidate a global alliance that unites democracies against Russia and China and thereby secures the free world for a generation to come.\u201d In this view, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine might be a pivotal episode in a global contest between autocracy and democracy. Chastened by Putin\u2019s gross violation of norms, democracies will band together in a muscular reaffirmation of the liberal international order. That is wishful thinking. The war is no doubt a seismic event that will have profound consequences for Russia, its immediate neighbors, and the rest of Europe. But it will neither reshape the global order nor presage an ideological showdown of democracies against China and Russia. After all, many of the world\u2019s biggest democracies, including India, have so far not joined the U.S.-led economic campaign against Russia or even explicitly condemned the invasion. Far from consolidating \u201cthe free world,\u201d the war has underscored its fundamental incoherence. In any case, the future of global order will be decided not by wars in Europe but by the contest in Asia, on which events in Ukraine have limited bearing. Many countries have heaped opprobrium on Russia, but condemnation has not been universal. The varied responses to the war muddle any vision of U.S.-aligned democracies pitted against Russian-aligned autocracies. Several major democracies, notably India and South Africa, abstained from the UN General Assembly vote on March 2 that demanded that Russia withdraw from Ukraine. Big democracies in Latin America, including Brazil and Mexico, have refused to participate in sanctions. Close to half of all Asian and African countries abstained or voted against the resolution. And only three Asian countries\u2014Japan, Singapore, and South Korea\u2014have wholeheartedly joined U.S. and EU sanctions on Russia. Countries in Asia were of course alarmed by the invasion. Stock markets throughout the region fell precipitously following the news of  Putin\u2019s gambit . But most commentary in Asian capitals has regarded the conflict as a war between Europeans over the European security order\u2014not an epochal global conflagration. Yes, the conflict has changed the European security calculus in fundamental ways. Western European countries have scrambled to strengthen their defenses, Germany has announced a process of rearmament, NATO is more unified than ever before, and the transatlantic alliance has been reinvigorated. The unprecedented stringency of the EU and U.S. economic sanctions on Russia is emblematic of this newfound Western unity. But from an Asian perspective, the war in Ukraine doesn\u2019t augur shifts to come so much as it underlines a shift that has already taken place. The fact that a war is being fought between Europeans on European soil is a reflection of how much global geopolitics has changed since the end of the Cold War. Before then, when Europe was the central fault line in the superpower contest, no wars were fought in the region; borders stayed frozen, lest any change provoke conflict between two nuclear-armed superpowers. But after the Cold War, conflict in Europe\u2014in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and today in Ukraine\u2014became neither unthinkable nor fraught with the same risks of annihilation or escalation, despite some alarmist panic about these apocalyptic possibilities today. Europe is a sideshow to the main theater of geopolitical drama: Asia. Today, the center of gravity of the world economy has moved from the Atlantic to east of the Urals. Geopolitical disputes and security dilemmas that could affect the global order are concentrated in maritime Asia. And the world seeks a new equilibrium to account for China\u2019s rise. The complex political dynamics in Asia don\u2019t lend themselves easily to the kind of stark confrontation underway in Ukraine. Policymakers in Western countries shouldn\u2019t think that their actions on the new frontlines in Europe will shape the contours of a wider struggle to come. To be sure, the war in Ukraine will have significant second-order effects on countries in Asia\u2014on their economic prospects when it comes to the supply of energy, precious and strategic metals, fertilizers, and grain. The slowdown in the  global economy  resulting from the spike in oil and gas prices will particularly affect countries in Asia which, by and large, account for almost 60 percent of crude oil imports in the global economy. The resulting rise in energy intensive fertilizer production costs will intensify the pain caused by the withdrawal from the market of Russian and Ukrainian wheat, which accounts for over 25 percent of wheat traded in the world. China is probably the Asian economy with the greatest economic exposure to Russia, for food, energy, and other products and as a market for Chinese exports. It also counts Ukraine as its third-largest source of imported arms, after Russia and France. So far, China has chosen Russia over Ukraine in its public stances, but its relationship with Russia can in no way compare with or replace China\u2019s economic dependence on the West. China will presumably want to avoid secondary sanctions and may therefore implement U.S. and EU sanctions on Russia where it cannot evade them. The rest of Asia is considerably less exposed to trade with Russia, and there is little or no Russian investment in South, Southeast, and East Asia. Yes, these countries will experience some turbulence thanks to the war. All South Asian countries, for instance, are net oil importers and are vulnerable to price surges just when their economies are undergoing pandemic-induced inflation and shocks. Most South Asian countries have elections upcoming in the next two years, and their incumbent leaders are likely to make populist decisions in handling the volatility of commodity prices, choosing subsidies, price cuts, and elevated debt over steps that would be more economically sound over the long term. But the war will not change the fundamental geopolitical dynamic in Asia, unless the United States becomes very distracted from its Indo-Pacific strategy. Many Asian countries, including U.S. allies, are economically bound to China yet rely on the United States for their security. India is one example. Its trade with China has set new records in the last two years despite frosty political relations and a military buildup and clashes along their shared border. At the same time, India\u2019s security and intelligence ties with the United States have increased substantially. Russia, which accounted for 88 percent of Indian arms imports in 2002, saw its share decline to 35 percent by 2020, by when the United States and its allies accounted for 65 percent. India does retain large stocks of legacy Russian platforms, but the trend toward diversification in its arms imports is clear and steady. This dynamic of multiple affiliations and partnerships is the norm in Asia, and it will complicate any Western framing of a larger confrontation with the autocracies of China and Russia. India has received a good deal of criticism for its reluctance to speak out against the war in Ukraine. (It also abstained from the February UN Security Council vote condemning the invasion.) U.S. officials have also warned India not to agree to Russian proposals that might help the Kremlin evade the effects of sanctions. For India, the war has posed a stark and unwelcome choice between the West and Russia, a choice that it has done everything possible to avoid making. The United States is an essential and indispensable partner in India\u2019s modernization, but Russia remains an important partner for geopolitical and military reasons. Whereas Russia is willing to codevelop and produce sensitive defense technologies such as the BrahMos missile and to share nuclear submarines with India, North America and Europe provide India with access to advanced technologies, markets, and financial and educational systems that Russia cannot match. The United States is an essential partner for India\u2019s maritime security in the Indo-Pacific, including working together under the auspices of the so-called Quad, a partnership that also incorporates Australia and Japan. But India\u2019s interests on the Eurasian continent require working with Russia and Iran now that the United States is no longer militarily present in Afghanistan. Indian diplomats have therefore chosen to stress the need to find a  negotiated way out of war in Ukraine , and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has encouraged Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to talk directly to each other to rapidly end the crisis. India has subtly expressed its unhappiness with the invasion by reiterating its support for Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity and sovereignty. If past experience is a guide, Indian officials will have made their displeasure clear to their Russian counterparts in private. Public opinion in India about the invasion remains divided, although many high-profile public figures have been stronger in their condemnation of the invasion than the government has been. But expecting New Delhi to take a more strident official position against Moscow is unrealistic, and Western criticism and pressure will probably rankle a postcolonial society like India\u2019s. As shocked as Western policymakers profess to be by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, they might remember that such behavior is neither unprecedented nor representative of a real change in the norms of state behavior in Europe and the world. For one, such a violation of sovereignty and territorial integrity is something that Asia has seen and experienced in the past at the hands of major powers. The long list of outside interventions and invasions (including the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the Vietnam War), of ongoing proxy wars and \u201cfrozen\u201d conflicts in which casualties mount daily, is proof that major powers are content to pay lip service to norms about sovereignty and territorial conflict even as those norms are repeatedly breached. Besides, it is hard to think of any powerful state that has not been associated with such acts of commission or omission in living memory. That does not justify Russian actions in Ukraine. But it does suggest that analysts and policymakers should use greater delicacy in how they frame the contest and in the demands they make on Asian and African states. No matter how long the war in Ukraine lasts, how the West isolates Russia, and how the war\u2019s secondary market effects hit Asian economies, the balance of power in Asia is unlikely to be significantly affected. To be sure, the total collapse of the Russian state would have serious ramifications, but that outcome seems unlikely for now. In Asia, the war will not close the gap in military strength between, on the one hand, the United States and China and, on the other, the large number of middle and subregional powers in Asia. The latter will still have to negotiate between the sole superpower and China. Nor does it seem likely that a newly consolidated Western alliance, however invigorated, will find the energy to take an active or meaningful role in security dilemmas in Asia so long as it is preoccupied with containing Russia in Europe. Instead of consolidation, the war in Ukraine seems likely to lead to greater fragmentation of the global order. It has reinforced the urge to build strategic autonomy in Europe as European countries begin to take a greater share in their own defense rather than rely to such an extent on the United States. It has also reinforced Asia\u2019s sense of its own difference\u2014its focus on stability, trade, and the bottom line that has served Asian countries so well in the last 40 years. The war will likely challenge economies that are already reeling from the pandemic and the retreat from globalization over the last decade. The combined economic and political effects of the war are likely to persuade Asian countries to embrace greater self-reliance, a trend already engendered by the pandemic. But Russia\u2019s invasion does not draw a line in the sand between the allies of the free world and its foes. A global Manichaean struggle is not in the offing. Those observers hoping for a conflict of that scope to arise from the rubble of Mariupol and Kharkiv will be disappointed. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

Reprint Permissions For three decades, U.S. foreign policy has run on inertia and called it strategy. The Cold War had ended, but the United States nonetheless retained its Cold War alliances. The Soviet Union had disappeared, but the absence of a major threat produced much the same prescription as the presence of a major threat had: just as the U.S. military had defended \u201cthe free world,\u201d now it would become the guardian of the whole world. When problems appeared, successive administrations generally took them as reasons to expand U.S. deployments. Even if its bid for primacy had created or exacerbated those problems, Washington had the solution: more and better primacy. Now the war in Ukraine is tempting policymakers to repeat that mistake in an exceedingly consequential way. Just when President Joe Biden had been trying to prioritize security in Asia and prosperity for the American middle class, advocates of U.S. primacy are seizing this emotionally charged moment to insist that post\u2013Cold War path dependency prevail. Rather than pivot to Asia, they argue, the United States must now build up its military presence in Europe to contain an assertive Russia, even as it strengthens its Indo-Pacific defenses to contain a rising China. They admit their proposal would cost hundreds of billions of dollars more in defense spending and put U.S. forces on the front lines of two potential great-power wars, but they think the price is worth it. The Biden administration should decline this invitation to wage a risky global cold war. Although the invasion of Ukraine has revealed Russian President  Vladimir Putin\u2019s  willingness to take risks in the pursuit of aggression, it has also exposed the weakness of the Russian military and economy. If anything, the war has strengthened the case for strategic discipline, by offering a chance to encourage Europe to balance against Russia while the United States concentrates on security in Asia and renewal at home. Such a division of labor is fair and sustainable. It would put the United States in the best position to limit the fallout from the war in Ukraine and achieve long-term peace and stability in Europe and beyond. Primacy\u2019s lure is strong in Washington, but a more restrained approach is better. D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU Since Russia\u2019s invasion began, advocates of U.S. primacy have contended that the war demands not only an immediate response from the United States but also an enduring grand-strategic shift. Riding a wave of anti-Russian sentiment, they want the Biden administration to cast aside the new, Asia-centric posture that it had been expected to roll out. \u201cWe cannot pretend any longer that a national security focus primarily on China will protect our political, economic and security interests,\u201d  wrote  former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. \u201cAs we have seen in Ukraine, a reckless, risk-taking dictator in Russia (or elsewhere) can be every bit as much a challenge to our interests and our security.\u201d To keep the war from expanding, the Biden administration has boosted the number of U.S. troops in Europe to around 100,000\u2014a level not seen in decades. But a bid to restore global military primacy is no more merited today than it was before the invasion. Putin\u2019s gruesome attack has made the Russian threat visceral, but it has not actually increased the threat or produced other compelling evidence for taking on new commitments or missions. Gates appears to confuse a humanitarian calamity with a threat to the United States. As the Biden administration has maintained, vital U.S. security interests are not at stake in Ukraine, and so the United States will not intervene directly against Russian forces. Especially unclear is why Putin or just any \u201creckless, risk-taking dictator\u201d should be presumed to challenge U.S. interests on a similar magnitude as China, the world\u2019s number two economic and military power.   Thinking that way could lead U.S. officials to give up on formulating strategy on the basis of discernable national interests. The United States would find itself policing the world, no matter the stakes. If Russia were to overrun the heartland of Europe, the United States\u2019 security and prosperity would become endangered, since much of the wealthy and populous region would come under Moscow\u2019s control. In the late 1940s, the United States waged the Cold War in part to prevent the Soviet Union from using its formidable resources to conquer noncommunist Europe. In a March  article  in  Foreign Affairs , the scholars Michael Beckley and Hal Brands implicitly resurrected this strategic objective by invoking \u201cthe policies that won the Cold War\u201d as a model for what to do today: contain Russia and China simultaneously through U.S. military buildups in both Europe and Asia. By their estimate, this course of action would require boosting defense spending over the next decade from 3.2 percent of GDP to five percent of GDP, making for a 56 percent increase. But it is difficult to discern how Russia could drive far into Europe, even if it tried. Before the invasion, the EU\u2019s economy was roughly five times as large as Russia\u2019s, by the conservative metric of purchasing power parity, and wartime sanctions are set to widen the gap. Taken together, the European members of NATO already outspend Russia on defense, and Europe\u2019s geopolitical awakening will only push them to spend more. And the lackluster performance of the Russian armed forces in Ukraine does not augur well for their prospects against NATO in the near term.  For three decades, U.S. foreign policy has run on inertia and called it strategy. Rather than explain how Russia could possibly come to dominate Europe, then, Beckley and Brands adopt an expansive conception of the United States\u2019 interests and responsibilities that would have made George Kennan, the architect of Cold War containment, blush. They would seemingly have the United States go to war to stop any act of \u201cautocratic aggression\u201d in eastern Europe or East Asia, and perhaps wherever else \u201cthe international order\u201d might appear to be imperiled. Indeed, as inspiration for their approach, they draw on NSC-68, the strategic document of 1950 that called for limitless anticommunist crusades and exorbitant military spending. As the historian John Lewis Gaddis has put it, NSC-68 \u201cfound in the simple presence of a Soviet threat sufficient cause to deem the interest threatened vital.\u201d In other words, NSC-68 had the United States assume vast costs and risks without reference to the country\u2019s safety and well-being; it severed the link between U.S. policy and U.S. interests. It should not be a template for our time. The call for a cold war against  China  and Russia would have Americans take on enormous burdens not because specific U.S. interests require it but because U.S. primacy does. No longer able to maintain global military dominance at the current level of exertion, the United States is now supposed to plow ever-greater resources into the endeavor. Perhaps the country could get away with strategic excesses in the 1950s, when it accounted for some 27 percent of world economic output, nearly double the combined Soviet and Chinese share of 14 percent. In 2020, by contrast, the United States accounted for 16 percent of global GDP. China and Russia together came to 22 percent. China alone topped the United States. It is doubtful that sheer will can overcome the chasm between the United States\u2019 material superiority during the Cold War and its shortfall today. Coming out of World War II, the American public understood the implications of undertaking obligations to defend other countries. By contrast, most Americans alive today, having never seen a great-power war or paid tangible costs for smaller wars, are not used to enduring hardship for foreign policy choices. Their well-founded suspicion of far-flung military interventions creates uncertainty about how the United States would truly act if one of its dozens of defense commitments came due. It also raises doubts about whether high defense spending could be sustained indefinitely. Rather than lock a new cold war into place, Biden should remember what produced the United States\u2019 greatest successes during the original affair: a willingness to adjust to changing circumstances and weigh creative options without clinging to outmoded habits. The Marshall Plan, for example, broke with precedent by extending government funds to rebuild European countries that   might have turned communist. Decades later, U.S. policymakers saw an opportunity to stabilize superpower relations and achieved d\u00e9tente, devising mutually beneficial arms control measures and stabilizing Europe through the Helsinki Accords. These achievements deserve to be emulated\u2014and that requires eschewing misplaced nostalgia. A EUROPE STRONG AND FREE The war in Ukraine has made strategic discipline not only more necessary but also more achievable. By turning Europe into a more unified and determined geopolitical actor, the war has generated international dynamics that are conducive to U.S. restraint.  Biden  should reject a cold war strategy of dividing the world and keeping one half dependent on the United States. He should not allow Putin\u2019s aggression to define the United States\u2019 concept of itself and its role in the world. Instead, he should seek to make the world resilient\u2014more capable of effective and collective action and less reliant on U.S. military protection.  The first step is to support Ukraine while avoiding escalation into a direct clash between U.S. and Russian forces. Having galvanized domestic and international action, the Biden administration should avoid the rhetorical inflation of its aims and stick to a clear goal: not to defend Ukraine but rather to help Ukraine defend itself and end the war. Accordingly, the administration should push for a peace settlement with as much vigor as it has displayed in imposing costs on  Russia .  A negotiated agreement will almost certainly require lifting at least some of the harshest sanctions on Russia, including the freeze of the Russian central bank\u2019s assets. The administration should proactively communicate an offer of sanctions relief to Moscow, which might not otherwise believe that such relief is possible. In conjunction with a pledge by Ukraine to give up on trying to join NATO, Biden should also be prepared to state publicly that the United States opposes further consideration of Ukraine\u2019s membership prospects, which were never high to begin with. After the war, the United States should continue to send weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself. It would not be necessary or wise to pledge to go to war on Ukraine\u2019s behalf, a commitment that would diminish American security and expand the U.S. military role in Europe. While avoiding the worst outcomes in Ukraine, Biden should take advantage of a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put the European security order on the path to self-sufficiency. With immense economic and demographic superiority, Europe is more than capable of developing the military power to balance Russia. Now, it seems increasingly willing to do so. But if Washington does not get out of its own way, change will not happen.  Biden should reject a cold war strategy of dividing the world and keeping one half dependent on the United States. Biden should back European strategic autonomy and make a six-year plan, to cover the rest of his term and the next one, to transition European defense to European leadership. The administration should press European countries to provide new manpower in the eastern countries of NATO and replace the additional U.S. troops sent there since January. And it should help European capitals coordinate their next steps: improving their forces\u2019 readiness and sustainability, developing capabilities for high-end operations, and harmonizing EU defense capabilities with those of a European-led, U.S.-supported  NATO . Limiting the United States\u2019 burdens in Europe would enhance its strategy in Asia. Biden would spare himself and his successors from facing the devil\u2019s choice that advocates of primacy would force on generations to come: weaken the United States\u2019 Indo-Pacific defenses in the event of a European war with Russia, or prepare to fight two great-power wars by raising defense spending so high as to court a political backlash. U.S. policymakers must steer clear of these unacceptable options. Nor need they resign themselves to a strategic competition with China so intense and encompassing as to resemble the early Cold War. Military restraint is desirable on strategic grounds, but it is also essential to freeing U.S. statecraft to pursue what matters most. The priorities that Biden identified when he came into office\u2014delivering prosperity for ordinary Americans and tackling  climate change  and pandemics\u2014remain just as important today, and the war has made them even harder to address. Russia\u2019s war and Western sanctions risk triggering a global recession or contributing to a period of stagflation. A downward economic spiral could even accompany a downward security spiral; countries could divide into economic blocs for fear that geopolitical contingencies may one day suddenly force them to join one grouping or another.  The United States should act to arrest deglobalization, which would depress growth and innovation and inhibit climate cooperation. Rather than succumb to a cold war framework, it should remain economically engaged with China and respect the sovereign choices of countries in the developing world to abstain from sanctions on Russia and otherwise opt for nonalignment. As surging prices compound the effects of the pandemic, the United States should rally its European and Asian partners to provide funds and technology to build renewable energy capacity in developing countries. Climate change is perhaps the biggest threat to the American people. If it remains a sideshow in national security policy by the end of Biden\u2019s tenure, then his foreign policy will have failed, no matter how well he handles the war in Ukraine. THE PRICE OF PRIMACY Among the priorities of the twenty-first-century  United States  should not be relations with  Iran . Nevertheless, the country may soon vault to the top of the president\u2019s agenda. Negotiators are currently trying to resurrect the agreement to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. If those talks break down, the Biden administration will have to decide whether to support a military strike on Iran, even though it will likely regard the country as a negligible concern and a distraction from  Ukraine . But even Ukraine is a distraction from what the administration had hoped to focus on: competition with  China , not to mention rescuing American democracy, mitigating a pandemic, and preserving a habitable planet. Such cacophony is the predictable result of the quest for global military  primacy \u2014not control over world events but the forfeiture of self-control. The problem will get ever worse as the unipolar moment continues to recede. A new cold war promises clarity of purpose. In reality, it would impose enormous costs and generate unnecessary risks. It would not, moreover, make other priorities go away; it would more likely exacerbate the United States\u2019 domestic travails and stifle urgent international cooperation. After 9/11, the United States allowed itself to become consumed by fears of the enemy. After Ukraine, the Biden administration should let nothing keep it from advancing the best interests of Americans. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

Citation Request Reprint Permissions During the 2020 presidential race, then candidate Joe Biden complained that U.S. President Donald Trump had \u201cabandoned all fiscal discipline when it comes to defense spending.\u201d Unsurprisingly, Biden\u2019s first budget\u2014announced in 2021\u2014was a dramatic about-face in fiscal priorities. The proposal increased spending for virtually every federal department except the Pentagon. Congress, for its part, considered Biden\u2019s proposal so deficient that it added an additional $29 billion for defense.  Despite congressional pushback and mounting global threats, Biden\u2019s new budget, announced last week, continues down the same dangerous path. Confronting emerging international dangers will require a dramatic increase in Washington\u2019s spending, and the administration\u2019s proposal is insufficient. The longer policymakers wait to make up this shortfall, the greater the risk the United States runs of operating without the forces it needs to win wars, and the more it tempts autocrats into taking advantage of American deficiencies. As Russia\u2019s disastrous invasion of Ukraine demonstrates, wars themselves\u2014not exercises or training\u2014are the real measure of military capabilities. To guarantee victory on the battlefield, the United States must make sure its capacities far outstrip those of its adversaries. But Washington\u2019s problems are bigger than money. U.S. policymakers face an intellectual crisis. Their approach to determining the military forces they need has become disconnected from the resources the military receives. The United States not only needs to find greater funding for the armed forces but it also must make sure that its strategy matches the resources it is willing to dedicate to the country\u2019s defense. SLASH AND BURN The first major downgrade of U.S. military capabilities since the 1950s came at the end of the Cold War. Between 1989 and 1992, the George H. W. Bush administration developed the so-called base force concept\u2014its attempt to reduce defense expenditures without seriously weakening the armed forces. Bush hoped to cut spending by 25 percent over five years by reorienting the military. Planners shifted from preparing for one apocalyptic war with a Soviet peer to smaller wars against regional powers, assumed longer warning times before conflict, and began substituting rotational forces for troops stationed permanently in bases around the world. The objective was to develop a military capable of fighting two independent major regional wars, with additional units available for reinforcement and a separate nuclear force. These changes produced a smaller military composed of 12 active and six reserve army divisions, 15 active and 11 reserve tactical fighter wings, and 451 ships, including 12 carriers. Although Bush\u2019s base force reduced spending, it also reduced the demands made on the armed forces. The divergence between military strategy and allocated resources really began with the 1993 \u201cbottom up review\u201d\u2014the Clinton administration\u2019s attempt to justify further reductions in defense spending. The review was still marketed as a way of allowing Washington to fight two major wars at the same time, but in practice, its prescriptions actually meant that major elements of the military would need to be used in both wars. The United States would need to rely on a \u201cwin-hold-win\u201d approach\u2014essentially fighting a single major regional war while freezing a second until forces could be shuttled from one to the other. And although the Clinton administration aimed to cut more than $100 billion in defense spending, its strategic goals were more expansive than those of its predecessor. U.S. strategy under Clinton accounted for all the threats anticipated by Bush\u2019s base force while also seeking to address the \u201cnew dangers\u201d of nuclear proliferation and sub-state conflict and expanding existing U.S. military missions to include peacekeeping. As a result, the United States\u2019 military budget and its armed forces could not keep pace with the ever-expanding scope of its articulated strategy. Congressional oversight of the military did little to resolve this mismatch of means and ends. Nowhere was this dynamic more evident than in sequestration\u2014the 2011 Budget Control Act\u2019s requirement that, absent congressional budget approval, agencies would have to make across-the-board cuts to discretionary spending. Sequestration dealt a severe blow to defense\u2014generating a gap between strategy and funding that the Defense Department has not yet been able to address.   Washington must make sure that its strategy matches the resources it is willing to dedicate to defense. Subsequent congressional failures to pass consistent budgets have exacerbated this mismatch. Instead of appropriating funding on time, it has become routine for Congress to pass short-term continuing resolutions that simply maintain funding at current levels. Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island and chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, estimates the cost of such stopgap measures at $34 billion, as the Pentagon cannot start new programs or stop old ones, provide pay raises, or shift funding to higher priorities. The Defense Department has been operating on continuing resolutions for six months of this year and for a total of 1,443 days over the last 12 years. That\u2019s nearly four full years of time and money that Washington can\u2019t get back. The last National Defense Strategy\u2014produced by the  Trump administration  in 2018\u2014also depended on future spending that neither the president nor Congress provided. Executing Trump\u2019s strategy would have required a real spending increase of three to five percent annually over that year\u2019s existing $670 billion defense budget. Such an increase has not been forthcoming. Today, taking the middle range of four percent growth over inflation, a rough calculation puts the 2022 Defense Department requirements at $906 billion. The funding just appropriated by Congress, however, amounts to $728 billion, meaning that the gap between Washington\u2019s strategy and its ability to carry out that strategy is a chasm of $178 billion. Congress, for its part, requires the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to report annually on the dangers associated with executing the National Defense Strategy. The last several chairmen have warned that the risks of not fully carrying out the strategy\u2019s requirements are rising, even if they said so quietly in public while more stridently in classified settings. But the military has also played a part in allowing the budget mismatch. Although then chairman General Martin Dempsey argued in 2013 that budget cuts would necessarily change Defense Department strategy, he went on to support an unaltered strategy when the Obama administration drastically cut the Pentagon\u2019s budget .  Last year, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and the current chairman, General Mark Milley, claimed that the budget \u201cis ample to accomplish things the department wants to do in the coming year.\u201d Left unsaid is whether the budget is adequate beyond the current year.  Despite this growing gap, the Biden administration does not seem poised to limit U.S. strategic objectives. In the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, policymakers claimed there was no need to change existing strategy since Russia posed only an \u201cacute\u201d threat. But the 82nd Airborne Division is now deployed in Poland, and an aircraft carrier has been dispatched to the Mediterranean\u2014meaning both are unavailable for the so-called pacing threat posed by China .  The Biden administration is also incorporating other issues such as  global health  and  climate change  into the defense strategy. The Pentagon evidently aspires to square this circle by arguing that so-called integrated deterrence\u2014the Defense Department\u2019s organizing principle for its upcoming strategy\u2014will reduce the demand for military forces by utilizing all elements of national power with exquisite orchestration. In reality, however, such a concept bases Pentagon strategy on forces beyond its control and is no substitute for a well-funded military. BUILD BACK BETTER? Former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell used to say, \u201cShow me your budget and I\u2019ll tell you your strategy.\u201d The  Biden administration\u2019s  ability to produce a budget that funds its expansive strategy is a test of its seriousness\u2014and it has been found wanting again. Congress had to step in after Biden\u2019s first attempt last year ,  and   his newly released budget asks for $773 billion, which doesn\u2019t even keep pace with inflation.  Congress, by contrast, seems poised to raise the Defense Department\u2019s budget significantly. Representative Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington and chair of the House Armed Services Committee, has said that \u201cthe Russian invasion of Ukraine fundamentally altered what our national security posture and what our defense posture needs to be.\u201d A strategy that accounts for Russian aggression in Europe will necessitate more forces and different kinds of weaponry than one solely focused on China. The Pentagon\u2019s own accounting of its unfunded needs from the last budget amounts to $22 billion. Addressing that deficit would be a good place to start.  Restoring U.S. naval capabilities, which have stagnated in recent decades, should be another major priority as the United States moves to  confront China . To start, policymakers should take up the Pentagon\u2019s plan for a 500-ship navy and begin developing the industrial base needed to build it. The Pacific is predominantly a maritime theater, and Beijing\u2019s fleet now surpasses what Washington has to defend its commitments in the region. Investing in shipbuilding could also provide some much-needed substance to the Biden administration\u2019s concept of \u201ca foreign policy for the middle class\u201d by creating more jobs at home. Analysts estimate the cost of attaining a 500-ship navy at $34 billion per year for 30 years, totaling over $1 trillion. Making this investment will also result in a valuable expansion of the defense industrial base\u2014the companies that build U.S. weapons and military systems.   Americans have allowed their military to atrophy. The United States needs to expand the U.S. military to match Washington\u2019s existing claims. The current U.S. military is sized to fight only a single war, as the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan revealed. Aligning strategy with reality should therefore be the focus of the defense planning process from start to finish. The price tag will be high: personnel costs for the current force comprise about 25 \u00a0percent  of the Defense Department\u2019s base budget. A force capable of fighting two wars would need roughly double the current number of 1.3 million service members,   at a cost of about $160 billion per year. The Defense Department also needs to adequately fund the construction and maintenance of military facilities and equipment, as the Pentagon tends to underfund or defer these problems when budgets are tight. The current figure for the maintenance and construction backlog is in the neighborhood of $140 billion. These delays have real consequences, including reducing the availability of important equipment and facilities. Navy dry docks, for instance, are more than 100 years old and in short supply (only one can hold a Ford-class aircraft carrier). As a result, U.S. shipyards are limited in how well they can service the fleet. U.S. forces are already too small for the existing strategy; Washington only limits them further by underfunding such logistical operations. Finally, policymakers need to reckon with the impending wave of decisions about the modernization of existing weapons systems. The majority of conventional and nuclear weapons systems are approaching the end of their service lives, even with extension programs that stretched their use well beyond their original retirement date. Many old systems are also bumping up against technological upgrades designed to keep them functional and interoperable with newer platforms. In 2016, defense analyst Todd Harrison estimated the total cost of developing new systems to replace the old ones at  $130 billion  across five years.  That number has only ballooned since then. STICKER SHOCK The changes needed to bring the Defense Department\u2019s budget back in line with its strategy involve a hefty price tag: around an additional $384 billion per year, a figure about 50 percent greater than the current Pentagon budget. Spending and program estimates also typically swell to two or three times initial estimates, and all these figures will need to be adjusted to the actual rate of inflation. As the saying goes, \u201cpretty soon you\u2019re talking about real money.\u201d Defense is expensive. It\u2019s inefficient. But it is an essential insurance policy designed to guarantee that the United States can protect itself, its allies, and its interests. Americans have allowed their military to atrophy, and they urgently need to restore both its reach and its punch. U.S. defense spending in 1953 was 11.3 percent of the country\u2019s gross domestic product; this year, it is 3.7 percent.   Washington needs to make up the gap before its adversaries gain too much ground. This should be a wake-up call. The United States must drop the excuses that have led it to so perilously underfund its defense. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

The combustion engine. The airplane. These are just some of the technologies that have forever changed the face of warfare. Now, the world is experiencing another transformation that could redefine military strength: the development of artificial intelligence (AI).  Merging AI with warfare may sound like science fiction, but AI is at the center of nearly all advances in defense technology today. It will shape how militaries recruit and train soldiers, how they deploy forces, and how they fight. China,  Germany ,  Israel , and the  United States  have all used AI to create real-time visualizations of active battlefields. Russia has deployed AI to make deepfake videos and spread disinformation about its invasion of Ukraine. As the  Russian-Ukrainian war continues , both parties could use algorithms to analyze large swaths of open-source data coming from social media and the battlefield, allowing them to better calibrate their attacks.  The United States is the world\u2019s  preeminent technological powerhouse , and in theory, the rise of AI presents the U.S. military with huge opportunities. But as of now, it is posing risks. Leading militaries often grow overconfident in their ability to win future wars, and there are signs that the U.S. Department of Defense could be falling victim to complacency. Although senior U.S. defense leaders have spent decades talking up the importance of emerging technologies,  including AI and autonomous systems , action on the ground has been painfully slow. For example, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy joined forces starting in 2003 to create the X-45 and X-47A prototypes: semiautonomous, stealthy uncrewed aircraft capable of conducting surveillance and military strikes. But many military leaders viewed them as threats to the F-35 fighter jet, and the air force dropped out of the program. The navy then funded an even more impressive prototype, the X-47B, able to fly as precisely as human-piloted craft. But the navy, too, saw the prototypes as threats to crewed planes and eventually backed away, instead moving forward with an unarmed, uncrewed aircraft with far more limited capabilities.  The United States\u2019 slow action stands in stark contrast to  the behavior of China , Washington\u2019s most powerful geopolitical rival. Over the last few years,  China  has invested roughly the same amount as the United States has in AI research and development, but it is more aggressively integrating the technology into its military strategy, planning, and systems\u2014potentially to defeat the United States in a future war. It has developed an advanced, semiautonomous weaponized drone that it is integrating into its forces\u2014unlike how Washington dropped the X-45, the X-47A, and the X-47B. Russia is also developing AI-enabled military technology that could threaten opposing forces and critical infrastructure (so far absent from its campaign against Ukraine). Unless Washington does more to integrate  AI  into its military, it may find itself outgunned.   AI is at the center of nearly all advances in defense technology today. But although falling behind on AI could jeopardize U.S. power, speeding ahead is not without risks. There are analysts and developers who fear that AI advancements could lead to serious accidents, including algorithmic malfunctions that could cause civilian casualties on the battlefield. There are experts who have even suggested that incorporating machine intelligence into nuclear command and control could make nuclear accidents more likely. This is unlikely\u2014most nuclear powers seem to recognize the danger of mixing AI with launch systems\u2014and right now, Washington\u2019s biggest concern should be that it is  moving too slowly . But some of the world\u2019s leading researchers believe that the Defense Department is ignoring safety and reliability issues associated   with AI, and the Pentagon must take their concerns seriously. Successfully capitalizing on AI requires the U.S. military to innovate at a pace that is both safe and fast, a task far easier said than done.  The Biden administration is taking positive steps toward this goal. It created the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Task Force, which is charged with spreading access to research tools that will help promote AI innovation for both the military and the overall economy. It has also created the position of chief digital and artificial intelligence officer in the Department of Defense; that officer will be tasked with ensuring that the Pentagon scales up and expedites its AI efforts.  But if the White House wants to move with responsible speed, it must take further measures. Washington will need to focus on making sure researchers have access to better\u2014and more\u2014Department of Defense data, which will fuel effective algorithms. The Pentagon must reorganize itself so that its agencies can easily collaborate and share their findings. It should also create incentives to attract more STEM talent, and it must make sure its personnel know they won\u2019t be penalized if their experiments fail. At the same time, the Department of Defense should run successful projects through a gauntlet of rigorous safety testing before it implements them. That way, the United States can rapidly develop  a panoply of new AI tools  without worrying that they will create needless danger.  FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGE  Technological innovation has long been critical to the United States\u2019 military success. During the American Civil War, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln used the North\u2019s impressive telegraph system to communicate with his generals, coordinate strategy, and move troops, helping the Union defeat the Confederacy. In the early 1990s, Washington deployed new, precision-guided munitions in the Persian Gulf War to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.  But history shows that military innovation is not simply the process of creating and using new technology. Instead, it entails reworking how states recruit troops, organize their militaries, plan operations, and strategize. In the 1920s and 1930s, for instance, France and Germany both developed tanks, trucks, and airpower. During World War II, Germany used the combined potential of these innovations (along with the radio) to carry out its infamous blitzkriegs: aggressive offensive strikes that quickly overwhelmed its enemies. France, by contrast, invested most of its resources in the Maginot Line, a series of forts along the French-German border. French leaders believed they had created an impenetrable boundary that would hold off any attempted German invasion. Instead, the Nazis simply maneuvered around the line by going through Belgium and the Ardennes forest. With its best units concentrated elsewhere, poor communication, and outdated plans for how to fight, France swiftly fell.  It is not a coincidence that France didn\u2019t gamble with new military systems.  France  was a World War I victor, and leading military powers often forgo innovation and resist disruptive change. In 1918, the British navy invented the first aircraft carrier, but the world\u2019s then dominant sea power treated these ships mostly as spotters for its traditional battleships rather than as mobile bases for conducting offensives. Japan, by contrast, used its aircraft carriers to bring attack planes directly to its fights. As a result, the British navy struggled against the Japanese in the Pacific, and ultimately, Japan had to be pushed back by another rising power: the United States. Before and throughout World War II, the U.S. Navy experimented with new technology, including aircraft carriers, in ways that helped it become the decisive force in the Atlantic and the Pacific.   Leading military powers often forgo innovation and resist change. But today, the United States risks being more like the United Kingdom\u2014or even France. The Defense Department appears to be biased in favor of tried-and-true capabilities over new tools, and its pace of innovation has slowed: the time it takes to move new technology from the lab and to the battlefield went from roughly five years, on average, in the early 1960s to a decade or more today. Sometimes, the Pentagon has seemingly dragged its feet on AI and autonomous systems because it fears that adopting those technologies could require disruptive changes that would threaten existing, successful parts of the armed forces, as the story of the X-45, the X-47A, and the X-47B clearly illustrates. Some projects have struggled to even make it off the drawing board. Multiple experiments have shown that Loyal Wingman, an uncrewed aircraft that employs AI, can help aircraft groups better coordinate their attacks. But the U.S. military has yet to seriously implement this technology, even though it has existed for years. It\u2019s no wonder that the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence concluded in 2021, in its final report, that the United States \u201cis not prepared to defend or compete in the AI era.\u201d  If the United States fails to develop effective AI, it could find itself at the mercy of increasingly sophisticated adversaries. China, for example, is already employing AI to war-game a future  conflict over Taiwan . Beijing plans to use AI in combination with cyberweapons, electronic warfare, and robotics to make an amphibious assault on Taiwan more likely to succeed. It is investing in AI-enabled systems to track undersea vehicles and U.S. Navy ships and to develop the ability to launch swarm attacks with low-cost, high-volume aircraft. If the United States lacks advanced AI capabilities, it will find itself inevitably moving at a slower pace\u2014and would therefore be less able to help Taiwan fend off an invasion.  RISKY BUSINESS  Given the stakes, the defense establishment is right to worry about Washington\u2019s torpid pace of defense innovation. But outside the government, many analysts have the opposite fear: if the military moves too quickly as it develops  AI weaponry , the world could experience deadly\u2014and perhaps even catastrophic\u2014accidents.  It doesn\u2019t take an expert to see the risks of AI: killer robots have been a staple of pop culture for decades. But science fiction isn\u2019t the best indicator of the actual dangers. Fully autonomous, Terminator-style weapons systems would require high-level machine intelligence, which even optimistic forecasts suggest is more than half a century away. One group of analysts made a movie about \u201cSlaughterbots,\u201d swarms of autonomous systems that could kill on a mass scale. But any government or nonstate actor looking to wreak that level of havoc could accomplish the same task more reliably, and cheaply, using traditional weapons. Instead, the danger of AI stems from deploying algorithmic systems, both on and off the battlefield, in a manner that can lead to accidents, malfunctions, or even unintended escalation. Algorithms are designed to be fast and decisive, which can cause mistakes in situations that call for careful (if quick) consideration. For example, in 2003, an MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile\u2019s automated system misidentified a friendly aircraft as an adversary, and human operators did not correct it, leading to the death by friendly fire of a U.S. F-18 pilot. Research shows that the more cognitively demanding and stressful a situation is, the more likely people are to defer to AI judgments. That means that in a battlefield environment where many military systems are automated, these kinds of accidents could multiply.  Humans, of course, make fatal errors as well, and trusting AI may not seem inherently to be a mistake. But people can be overconfident about the accuracy of machines. In reality, even very good AI algorithms could potentially be more accident-prone than humans. People are capable of considering nuance and context when they are making decisions, whereas AI algorithms are trained to render clear verdicts and work under specific sets of circumstances. If entrusted to launch missiles or employ air defense systems outside their normal operating parameters, AI systems might destructively malfunction and launch unintended strikes. It could then be difficult for the attacking country to convince its opponent that the strikes were a mistake. Depending on the size and scale of the error, the ultimate outcome could be a ballooning conflict.  This has frightening implications. AI-enabled machines are unlikely to ever be given the power to actually launch nuclear attacks, but algorithms could eventually make recommendations to policymakers about whether to launch a weapon in response to an alert from an early warning air defense system. If AI gave the green light, the soldiers supervising and double-checking these machines might not be able to adequately examine their outputs and monitor the machines for potential errors in the input data, especially if the situation was moving extremely quickly. The result could be the inverse of an infamous 1983 incident in which a Soviet air force lieutenant arguably saved the world when, correctly suspecting a false alarm, he decided to override a nuclear launch directive from an automated warning system. That system had mistaken light reflecting off of clouds for an inbound ballistic missile.  FAST, NOT LOOSE  The United States, then, faces dueling risks from AI. If it moves too slowly, Washington could be overtaken by  its competitors , jeopardizing national security. But if it moves too fast, it may compromise on safety and build AI systems that breed deadly accidents. Although the former is a larger risk than the latter, it is critical that the United States take safety concerns seriously. To be effective, AI must be safe and reliable.  So how can Washington find a sort of Goldilocks zone for innovation? It can start by thinking of technological development in terms of three phases: invention, incubation, and implementation. Different speeds are appropriate for each one. There is little harm from moving quickly in the first two phases, and the U.S. military should swiftly develop and experiment with new technologies and operational concepts. But it will need to thoroughly address safety and reliability concerns during implementation.  To strike this balance, the U.S. military will need to make sure its personnel get a better handle on all of the Department of Defense\u2019s data. That includes open-source content available on the Internet, such as satellite imagery, and intelligence on adversaries and their military capabilities. It also includes data on the effectiveness, composition, and capabilities of the U.S. military\u2019s own tools.  The Department of Defense already has many units that collect such data, but each unit\u2019s information is siloed and stored in different ways. To more effectively adopt AI, the Pentagon will need to build on its ongoing efforts to create a common data infrastructure. The department is taking an important step by integrating its data and AI responsibilities under the aegis of the chief digital and artificial intelligence officer. But this reorganization will not succeed unless the new official has the authority to overcome bureaucratic barriers to AI adoption in both the military services and other parts of the Pentagon.  Giving researchers better data will also help ensure that  every algorithm  undergoes rigorous safety testing. Examiners, for example, could deliberately feed a wide range of complex or outright incorrect information into an AI system to see if it creates a faulty output\u2014 such as a directive to strike a friendly aircraft. This testing will help create a baseline idea of how reliable and accurate AI systems are, establishing a margin of error that eventual operators can keep in mind. This will help humans know when to question what machines tell them, even in high-pressure scenarios.  Manufacturing innovative and secure AI will also require a tighter connection between the Department of Defense\u2019s Research and Engineering arm and the rest of the Pentagon. In theory, Research and Engineering is in charge of the department\u2019s technological innovation. But according to  a report by Melissa Flagg and Jack Corrigan  at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology, the Pentagon\u2019s innovation efforts are disorganized, taking place across at least 28 organizations within the broader department. These efforts would all benefit from more coordination, something the Research and Engineering arm can provide. One recent reason for optimism is that Research and Engineering recently created the Rapid Defense Experimentation Reserve, an initiative that will allow the department to more quickly create prototypes and experiment with emerging technologies in high-need areas across the military, which should increase coordination and speed up adoption.   Military power is more about people and organizations than widgets or tools. But the Pentagon can\u2019t spur more effective innovation solely through structural reforms. It will need the right people, as well. The United States is fortunate to have a highly trained and educated military, yet it requires even more STEM talent if it is going to win the wars of the future. That means the Department of Defense must hire more personnel who study AI. It also means the Pentagon should offer coding and data analytics courses for existing staff and give extra cash or more time off to employees who enroll\u2014just as it does for personnel who study foreign languages.  As part of its overhaul, the Defense Department will also need to change its culture so that it is not, as  Miche\u0300le Flournoy, former undersecretary of defense for policy, described  it in these pages last year, too \u201crisk averse.\u201d Currently, department officials often slow-walk or avoid risky initiatives to avoid the reputational damage that accompanies failure, burying promising projects in the process. This is completely backward: trial and error is integral to innovation. Senior leaders in the Pentagon should reward program managers and researchers for the overall number of experiments and operational concepts they test rather than the percentage that are successful.  Even unsuccessful investments can prove strategically useful. The Chinese military pays close attention to U.S. military capabilities and planning, allowing the United States to  potentially disrupt Beijing\u2019s own planning  by selectively revealing prototypes, including ones that did not pan out. China might respond by chasing sometimes flawed U.S. systems, while being uncertain about what the United States will actually deploy or develop next. If the U.S. military wants to remain the world\u2019s strongest, it must continue making its adversaries follow it around.  It will also need to develop ways to effectively use whatever technologies it does decide to deploy. Military power is ultimately more about people and organizations than widgets or tools, and history shows that even the most successful militaries need to incorporate new capabilities into their plans if they want to win on the battlefield. As conventional warfare makes an unfortunate comeback, the United States will need to adapt and restructure its military for the future\u2014rather than resting on its laurels.

February 2021, two weeks after taking office, U.S. President  Joe Biden  gave a speech outlining his foreign policy vision. Over the course of 20 minutes, the new president detailed many of Washington\u2019s overseas interests, including promoting democracy and working with U.S. allies to compete against China. He identified a bevy of international challenges, including cyberattacks, nuclear proliferation, and refugee flows. But when it came time to talk about international economics, Biden pivoted away from looking abroad and instead focused his attention at home. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind.\u201d Washington, he said, must advance \u201ca foreign policy for the middle class.\u201d  That final phrase\u2014\u201ca foreign policy for the middle class\u201d\u2014has become the lens through which the Biden administration has pursued its international economic agenda. On the whole, it means striking a balance between promoting the interests of U.S. working families and pursuing the more strategic and often realpolitik agenda that drives the United States\u2019 national security interests, especially confronting the challenges posed by increasing competition with China. It entails creating a more pro-union, industrial policy approach to investing in U.S. domestic economic renewal and competitiveness so that Washington can continue to project U.S. power. It requires shoring up national security vulnerabilities in supply chains in a way that benefits workers. And it involves working with allies and like-minded countries, strengthening U.S. multilateral leadership, and addressing the failures of former President  Donald Trump\u2019s  China strategy\u2014in particular by confronting unfair and illegal Chinese economic behavior that hurts American workers, threatens U.S. technological leadership, and undermines international competitiveness.  After over a year in office, Biden\u2019s record on striking an appropriate balance between a foreign policy that is focused on workers and one that involves realpolitik is mixed. He succeeded in striking that balance with his supply chain resilience agenda, including efforts to \u201creshore\u201d and \u201cfriend-shore\u201d production in a way that advanced middle-class priorities and brought manufacturing jobs back home. He passed a landmark $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure and investment act, a large down payment on economic renewal and competitiveness with strengthened \u201cBuy American\u201d policies. He also successfully breathed new life into the United States\u2019 relationships with allies in both the Atlantic and the Pacific regions. This meant Biden was well positioned to advance collective opposition to Russian aggression in Ukraine through sanctions and other economic tools and to jointly take on economic competition with China, especially with European partners.  But on addressing other economic and strategic threats posed by China\u2014including its massive subsidization of domestic companies, its theft of U.S. intellectual property, and its habit of forcing U.S. companies to hand over their technology\u2014the Biden administration has fallen short. It is behind in its battle with Beijing over trade, technology, and Asia\u2019s economic architecture. The administration\u2019s neglect of international financial institutions has allowed China to increasingly gain influence over other countries, undermining U.S. leadership and damaging the United States strategic economic and financial interests around the world.  Biden has, in particular, struggled to craft a coherent trade agenda. Although the president managed to simultaneously help workers and reengage on trade, technology, and economic security with European allies, in the Indo-Pacific, the administration\u2019s unbalanced and sequential approach has deferred crucial multilateral, trade, and investment initiatives at the expense of longer-term U.S. strategic security. During the campaign, Biden argued that Trump\u2019s  use of tariffs  and his trade policy with China left U.S. farmers and workers no closer to getting the level playing field they deserved. Once Biden won, he promised to undertake a comprehensive review of Washington\u2019s economic policies toward China and to then launch a comprehensive new strategy for the region. But the administration never finished the review, and it never created a fresh approach. The Trump administration\u2019s much-maligned Phase One trade deal\u2014its attempt to correct Chinese economic behavior in exchange for lower tariffs\u2014remains in place, surprisingly unaltered. Major Chinese economic abuses still go unchallenged.   Biden has struggled to craft a coherent\ntrade agenda. The stakes are now higher, as Indo-Pacific commerce, trade, and investment grow and evolve. China advanced the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which went into effect earlier this year, and even formally applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the successor to a trade deal that the United States negotiated in 2015 before withdrawing under Trump. China is arguably well on track to set the digital standards that will dominate Asia for decades. This means U.S. workers may find that the continent\u2019s enormous export market is incompatible with the products they are producing, cutting their employers off from billions of potential consumers and making that market captive to China\u2019s export machine instead. Ironically, the Biden administration is reluctant to cut trade deals with the region because it is worried that doing so will undermine its ability to win support from domestic workers. But by staying on the sidelines, the United States is both limiting its own workers\u2019 opportunities and passing up the chance to lead the Indo-Pacific\u2019s economic future.  In recent months, it has become more complicated for the United States to properly align domestic and international economic priorities in Asia. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in late February forced the Biden administration to rework its domestic and international priorities literally overnight. The emphasis on persuading allies to counter China\u2019s economic ambitions and growing influence over trade rules and practices was replaced by the need for a massive collective application of hard economic coercive power against Russia, carried out through unprecedented sanctions and export controls. Before the invasion, U.S. economic policy was focused on strengthening long-term supply chain resilience to ensure the United States had reliable access to critical raw materials, manufactured products, and pharmaceuticals, which are disproportionately produced in China. After the invasion, Washington shifted to addressing immediate commodity shortfalls and energy vulnerabilities from Russia and Ukraine, including not only oil and gas but also wheat, nickel, palladium, and the other critical materials needed for semiconductors and electronics. Even the administration\u2019s bold  climate endeavors , designed to help the world move away from fossil fuels, have been given a harsh reality check. The administration has had to confront the risk of demonizing domestic natural gas producers and oil companies, forcing Washington to make a rapid diplomatic about-face in the Middle East and Venezuela to get oil pumping again.  The challenge posed by China has not diminished, and the invasion has not reduced the need to ensure that Biden\u2019s international economic policy agenda remains focused on both immediate and longer-term strategic challenges. In fact, China\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s aggression presents the Biden team with an opportunity. Much of the world is wary of China\u2019s failure to condemn, and its possible support for, Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. The White House can capitalize on this to try to constrain China\u2019s global ambitions, its growing influence, and its threats to the U.S. middle class. The administration\u2019s task now is to take advantage of the current turmoil to recraft a global economic system that will both preserve U.S. leadership and help American workers: a real foreign policy for the middle class.  AT HOME IN THE WORLD  Biden\u2019s international economic agenda was designed to inextricably link his domestic economic plans and the country\u2019s national economic security. Biden promised to invest in domestic supply chains, infrastructure, innovation, research and development, and manufacturing, as well as to rebuild U.S. alliances to jointly advance common economic security interests.  In an effort to insulate the U.S. economy from international threats, the president began his tenure by conducting a strategic review of U.S. supply chain resilience, designed to identify where the United States was least self-sufficient. By June 2021, the administration had cataloged the country\u2019s main vulnerabilities, chiefly in semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, batteries, and key minerals and materials with implications for U.S. defense and commercial resilience. It expanded the review to include six industrial sectors with vulnerabilities, and it then crafted strategies to strengthen each.  The White House followed this up by creating a multiyear action plan, using both public and private investment, to bring manufacturing for certain critical products back to the United States. The federal government reworked its procurement procedures to invest in new battery production and to stockpile critical minerals and metals. It also implemented new \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions, which closed legal loopholes and got the federal government to use more domestic goods in its own procurement. This was all consonant with Biden\u2019s worker-centric agenda.  The Trump administration had also tried to reshore domestic manufacturing. But Trump\u2019s efforts mostly consisted of haphazard, counterproductive tariffs on friends and competitors alike. This alienated allies and did little to address the trade deficit that he argued was at the root of the United States\u2019 economic woes. Biden, by contrast, has worked with allies in both Europe and the Indo-Pacific to build supply chain resilience. He recognized that countries in both regions were themselves at risk of  being victims  of China\u2019s aggressive, weaponized trade policies. Beijing, for example, had issued vindictive trade restrictions on Australia after Canberra called for an independent inquiry into the origins of  COVID-19 .   Biden, unlike Trump, has worked with allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. Biden\u2019s supply chain diplomacy was embedded in the establishment of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council in June 2021; the council is addressing the United States\u2019 and Europe\u2019s shared vulnerability in areas such as critical minerals, semiconductors, and battery production. That diplomacy was also on display in October 2021, when, on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting in Rome, the administration hosted a summit on global supply chain resilience with leaders from 14 other countries and the EU, including Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (which is the world\u2019s leading source of cobalt, a metal key to the transition to green energy), India, Japan, and South Korea.  Within his first year, Biden also realized one of his most ambitious campaign promises: investing $1 trillion in the country\u2019s long-neglected infrastructure. His massive bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will improve the United States\u2019 transportation systems, strengthen its digital connectivity, boost the country\u2019s cybersecurity, and create a greener, more resilient energy grid. These changes may seem largely domestic in nature, but they have implications for foreign policy. Better cybersecurity, for example, will protect the United States from hacking by China, Russia, and nonstate actors. Improved infrastructure will strengthen the U.S. economy\u2019s ability to compete with a rising China. And the infrastructure package will create more, better jobs for Americans, especially in underrepresented parts of the country.  Biden\u2019s domestic economic security policy is not yet finished. To counter China and boost U.S. innovation, manufacturing, and research and development, Congress will need to soon finalize and pass a bipartisan innovation and competitiveness bill. This legislation would mean substantial federal investment in quantum computing, semiconductors, robotics, and artificial intelligence\u2014industries China seeks to dominate. The Russian-Ukrainian war, meanwhile, will subject the world to a variety of critical shortages, including of semiconductor materials; the United States will need plans to address this.  BURYING THE HATCHET  Under Trump, the United States  turned its back  on its allies and partners. The former president imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from EU countries\u2014arguing that those imports were threats to U.S. national security\u2014and by the end of his term, the United States\u2019 closest friends harbored deep misgivings about Washington\u2019s intentions. That mistrust posed a significant threat to Biden\u2019s economic agenda, including his plans for competing with China. In December 2020, after Biden had won the presidential election but before he took office, the EU announced that it had agreed to a proposed investment deal with China called the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment, despite objections from Biden\u2019s team. (Although the EU has since indefinitely postponed full approval of the agreement, it did so because of Chinese diplomatic missteps, not because of the incoming Biden administration\u2019s request.)  To try to repair this damage, Biden quickly worked to improve the United States\u2019 relations with its allies and partners. Within a month of Biden\u2019s tenure, the United States was back in the Paris climate accord. Thereafter, Washington helped spearhead a new agreement on carbon emissions and other climate targets at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP26. In an effort to address COVID-19-related economic shortfalls, particularly in poor countries, the administration agreed to support an allocation of $650 billion in Special Drawing Rights by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). And to level the playing field in global taxation, the White House helped finalize an agreement on global tax reform, including a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 percent, spearheaded by the  G-20  and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.  For Biden, the tax agreement\u2014which brought together over 130 countries representing more than 90 percent of the planet\u2019s GDP\u2014is a particularly clear example of how his \u201cforeign policy for the middle class\u201d can successfully balance domestic and international objectives. The deal not only reestablished U.S. international engagement and protected U.S. companies from being unfairly taxed in other jurisdictions; it also advanced a key campaign promise to ensure that companies pay their fair share. Although the deal still requires U.S. congressional action and similar government approval in other countries, it nevertheless established the multilateral economic bona fides of the Biden administration.  Biden speaking at the G-20 summit in Rome, October 2021   Kevin Lamarque / Reuters   The United States has also partnered with certain allies to coordinate their approaches to key global technology, economic, and trade issues. The U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, for example, was almost entirely designed to address the challenges posed by China\u2019s state-led economic model and counter unfair trade practices that hurt American and European workers. The council is helping the United States and the European Union ensure that they have compatible technology standards and data protection, implement export controls on dual-use technology, and create investment screening protocols to protect against intellectual property and technology theft (which undermines competitiveness and national security).  Then, shortly after the Biden team began its second year in office, recalling the words of former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, events intervened: Russia invaded Ukraine. But nothing better illustrates the success of Biden\u2019s work with U.S. allies than what happened before and directly after Russia\u2019s invasion. In the lead-up to the war, the Biden team worked with its G-7 and additional European partners to prepare a coordinated menu of escalating coercive economic measures, both to deter an invasion and to prepare a concerted response for if a war took place. The United States also ramped up its energy security cooperation in the months leading up to the invasion, as Russia increasingly used gas exports as a coercive weapon against Europe. As a result, immediately after the invasion began, the United States and its allies were able to pull off an unprecedented degree of international coordination, rapidly imposing historically severe economic sanctions and export controls on a major economy.  HELP WANTED  Unlike the Biden administration\u2019s determined efforts to rebuild bilateral trust and relationships, its attempts to reestablish leadership in international financial institutions\u2014including the IMF, the World Bank, and regional multilateral development banks\u2014have failed to gain traction. These institutions were expected to play a crucial role in advancing the administration\u2019s international agenda, especially given the pressing need to contain the global economic fallout of COVID-19. And at first, the White House made good, supporting the historic Special Drawing Rights issuance to help low- and middle-income countries deal with the economic challenges posed by the pandemic.  Thereafter, however, the administration\u2019s efforts stalled. Perhaps because the White House was disproportionately focused on its domestic agenda, it showed little interest in reforming the World Trade Organization, declined to appoint an American to the number two leadership position at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development when given the opportunity last year, and replaced the top U.S.-held position at the IMF\u2014the first deputy managing director\u2014only after the institution\u2019s leader was engulfed in a China-related data-rigging scandal. Crucially, Biden neglected to prioritize filling the unprecedented number of vacancies in key posts on the executive boards of international financial institutions and in the U.S. Treasury Department; the people in these posts are supposed to set vital international economic policies. As a result, Washington has struggled to advance its strategic economic interests through key multilateral institutions. It also neglected to promote a major priority of unions: advancing a global, worker-centric perspective within international institutions themselves.  Biden has also been unable to address China\u2019s broad refusal to provide debt relief to poor countries. China is now the dominant creditor to developing states around the world, and when COVID-19 made debt repayment more difficult, the IMF and the World Bank proposed a G-20 \u201cCommon Framework\u201d for debt relief, seeking to create a forum in which China could work constructively toward that end with the IMF and the Paris Club, a group of creditor countries that seek solutions to payment problems faced by debtor countries. But the effort largely failed, primarily because China refused to accept meaningful debt forgiveness or, in many cases, to even allow visibility into the nature and terms of its loans. China\u2019s investment in countries around the world not only gives Beijing greater influence over the politics and economics of these debtor countries; it also gives it more control over the supply of key commodities and, increasingly, over the development of digital standards in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. With the Biden administration mainly disengaged from leadership at both the IMF and the World Bank, the United States missed the opportunity to use these institutions to push back against China\u2019s intransigence. Meanwhile, the failure of Washington to demonstrate real interest in governance at these institutions has contributed to governance and morale issues that currently plague their broader effectiveness.  That\u2019s not to say Biden has taken no formal, multilateral steps to try to counter Chinese economic leadership. In June 2021, his administration and the G-7 launched the Build Back Better World initiative, which will use financial support from members of the G-7 to help fund and coordinate infrastructure projects in the developing world. But although worthy of praise, Build Back Better World remains nascent and underfunded, especially compared with China\u2019s enormous bilateral lending, estimated to have reached more than $500 billion.  DISAGREEING TO AGREE  The Biden team can count a few trade and investment wins in its first year, including temporarily resolving a 17-year dispute with the EU over subsidies to Airbus and Boeing. It also reached an agreement with the EU over steel and aluminum tariffs that creatively addressed both the United States\u2019 and Europe\u2019s concerns about Chinese overcapacity by linking the deal to greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, Washington found a union-friendly fix for Vietnam\u2019s currency manipulation transgressions.  But the White House has had trade troubles. Indeed, overall, the Biden administration\u2019s most glaring international economic policy failure has been its inability to articulate or advance a coherent strategic trade and investment policy in the Indo-Pacific. The Biden administration has not yet agreed on a new economic approach to its relationship with China, effectively maintaining the Phase One trade deal inherited from Trump. It has made little serious effort to address Washington\u2019s underlying grievances with Chinese economic policy. What is most striking is how it has not seriously coordinated with Indo-Pacific countries on an economic strategy, in part because it has avoided even mentioning free-trade or investment agreements. In particular, it has declined to enter into any discussion of reengaging with the CPTPP.  The refusal to talk trade has exposed how failing to properly balance domestic and international interests can undermine longer-term strategic goals. While running for president, Biden promised the United Steelworkers in writing that he would not \u201center into any new trade agreements until we\u2019ve made major investments here at home\u201d\u2014part of his broader campaign to win back swing states and working-class voters. That pledge was both tragic and self-defeating; by foreclosing even the discussion of any new trade agreements, Biden squandered the United States\u2019 best opportunity to make the international economic order more friendly to the American middle class and to advance crucial U.S. foreign policy interests. As the most attractive market economy in the world, the United States can use trade negotiations to get countries to change their standards, rules, and norms, in part by promising increased market access. That means there are enormous strategic and economic benefits to at least reentering the debate over whether the United States should join the CPTPP, so as to present an alternative to China\u2019s increasing dominance over Asian trade (which is bad for both U.S. workers and U.S. foreign policy). And yet the Biden administration has effectively forbidden any suggestion that joining the CPTPP might, in fact, be the single most significant step the country could take to advance its foreign policy for the middle class.  There are spillover effects. In September 2021, China applied to join the CPTPP. Many of the agreement\u2019s existing members, including countries in Latin America, are building better relations with Beijing as a result, preparing for the possibility that China will belong to the CPTPP, with the United States on the outside looking in. The White House knows this isn\u2019t good, and it has belatedly tried to craft a new economic engagement strategy for Asia: the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. But it focuses on largely amorphous objectives and consists of aspirational wish lists, mostly devoid of specifics. This initiative is neither a substitute for a free-trade agreement nor a serious attempt to reassert Washington\u2019s influence over trade with, investment in, or the digital future of the Indo-Pacific.  SQUARING THE CIRCLE  After more than a year in office, Biden has advanced many critical international economic policy goals by aligning his administration\u2019s foreign policy agenda with the interests of U.S. workers, achieving strategic national security objectives. He laid the groundwork for creating more resilient supply chains and transforming U.S. infrastructure in ways that will help underserved communities and the middle class. He rejoined the global community\u2019s effort to transition away from fossil fuels. He repaired U.S. alliances, marshaling the democratic world to collectively respond to Russia after it invaded  Ukraine .  Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine and its subsequent isolation are likely to provide  ample opportunity  for the United States to cooperate even more with its allies, as well as a chance for Washington to broaden the circle of countries with which it can find common cause. Russian economic isolation represents a global economic structural shift of significant proportions, one that may lead to further economic and political decoupling, and the United States must be prepared to protect and advance its economic interests in this new paradigm.  China\u2019s future role in this world remains uncertain. China\u2019s neutrality, if not vaguely pro-Russian position, on the war in Ukraine has given Washington a chance to reassert its global leadership. It must now be willing to recognize these opportunities and find a way to address both more immediate domestic interests and longer-term strategic ones that can pay economic dividends for decades to come. To capitalize on this moment, the United States must be ready to embrace a more ambitious international economic policy that advances its and its allies\u2019 standards of fair trade, commerce, and investment, especially in response to China\u2019s increasingly aggressive international posture. That means a top priority for the administration must include a renewed focus on articulating a comprehensive economic strategy for China, including a concrete, ambitious trade and investment agenda for the Indo-Pacific.  It won\u2019t be easy for the Biden administration to reestablish U.S. economic leadership. Many middle-class Americans continue to blame globalization in general, and trade in particular, for their economic struggles. For Democrats, it does not pay to be seen as the party of pro-globalization, coastal elites. Biden will therefore need to work hard at explaining that free and fair trade can advance the interests of the middle class, of unions, and of workers. He should follow through on his promise to bring labor and environmental interests to the negotiating table. But cutting off U.S. trade engagement or believing the country has time to defer introducing an Indo-Pacific economic agenda will further cede turf to  China \u2014ultimately restricting markets and posing more risks to American workers, not less.   It does not pay to be seen as the party of pro-globalization, coastal elites. Biden will also need to make good on promises to renew U.S. economic leadership in multilateral financial institutions, rather than letting them lose further credibility. These institutions can amplify U.S. influence, and the White House should make engaging with them a priority. That means it cannot pass up future opportunities to nominate strong, qualified U.S. candidates for traditionally U.S.-held leadership positions at these organizations.  Working with the IMF and the World Bank will be key. Food insecurity, inflation, rising interest rates, and massive levels of debt in low-income countries threaten financial stability, especially in developing markets, and the IMF and the World Bank can help the world manage and mitigate the risks. The White House should exert pressure on the IMF and the World Bank to abide by their own rules on debt sustainability. It must also be prepared to demand that China provide transparency and appropriate debt relief to poor countries that fall into debt distress. It should prioritize initiatives, such as Build Back Better World, that challenge China\u2019s lending and investment leadership. This will be particularly important when it comes to helping states with the transition to green energy.  Finally, the Biden administration must manage the economic and political consequences of the war in Ukraine. The invasion has upended many of the underlying assumptions of Biden\u2019s proposed foreign policy for the middle class. At the same time, it challenges China\u2019s rise, and in that way, it presents an opportunity for Biden to make up for lost time, including by moving past some of the political impediments\u2014such as domestic opposition to joining the CPTPP\u2014that have stood in the way of smart international choices. This opportunity could help Biden, and the United States, secure a win-win: an international economic policy agenda that strikes the appropriate balance between workers\u2019 interests at home and the country\u2019s strategic interests abroad.

Today, however, calm has returned to the streets of Almaty and other major Kazakh cities. Now firmly in charge, Tokayev appears bent on demonstrating to Kazakhstan\u2019s long-suffering citizens that, three decades after becoming independent from the Soviet Union, their country is beginning a fresh chapter in its history. Tokayev is purging Kazakhstan\u2019s government of the influence of his authoritarian predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who retained significant clout in government and the private sector, even after resigning from the presidency in 2019. Members of Nazarbayev\u2019s family have already been removed from top posts at Kazakhstan\u2019s election commission, its most influential business lobbying group, and its leading oil and gas companies. The head of Kazakh intelligence\u2014Karim Masimov, Nazarbayev\u2019s longtime political ally and two-time prime minister\u2014has been arrested on charges of treason. Tokayev has also announced a major audit\u00a0and restructuring of Kazakhstan\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, including new personnel recruiting and procurement procedures\u00a0intended to diminish cronyism, which is believed to be valued at $69 billion and to control at least 55 percent of the country\u2019s assets. But Kazakhstan\u2019s oligarchic network extends well beyond its borders. A 2019 KPMG report estimated that the 162 richest Kazakhs control fully half of the country\u2019s wealth, most of which is now held offshore in Geneva, London, New York, Paris, and other global financial centers, beyond the reach of the Kazakh authorities. In an address to his cabinet in early February, Tokayev ordered his government\u00a0to devise plans for repatriating these assets within two months. He also pointedly noted the $5.7 billion discrepancy between China\u2019s and Kazakhstan\u2019s official reporting on the volume of trade between the two countries, suggesting cross-border smuggling on a massive scale. Importantly, Tokayev\u2019s own credentials as a reformer remain in doubt, as a recent report\u00a0by the Organized Crime and  Corruption  Reporting Project (OCCRP) also revealed that Tokayev and his family members themselves had accumulated significant wealth overseas, including Swiss bank accounts, a UK-registered company, and real estate holdings in Russia and Switzerland. Even locating these assets presents logistical and legal challenges that will take the Tokayev government years, not months, to overcome. The former ruling family and its enablers spent decades stashing illegally acquired state funds overseas, in preparation for just such a global asset hunt. Most of the Nazarbayev clan\u2019s vast offshore holdings remain hidden. Efforts to find and repatriate them will not only complicate Kazakhstan\u2019s political transition but also draw in Western lawyers, accountants, and reputation-management firms\u2014while challenging Western governments to actually implement their global anticorruption commitments. Soon after the January unrest had been subdued, Tokayev appeared to strike a deal with Nazarbayev. Throughout the crisis, Tokayev had blamed the persistent economic inequality that drove many of the protesters focused on the Nazarbayev family\u2019s corruption. In his first public appearance after the demonstrations, Nazarbayev denied any political rift with his successor, demurely claiming that he was just an ordinary pensioner now, hoping for a quiet retirement. In exchange for being allowed to retire in Kazakhstan, Nazarbayev suggested, he has accepted Tokayev\u2019s authority and withdrawn himself and his inner circle\u00a0from positions of political and economic influence. There is a problem with this apparently peaceful transition pact, however. Neither Tokayev, nor the ministry of finance, nor the central bank, nor the prosecutor general\u2019s office knows the true extent of the Nazarbayevs\u2019 global holdings. As the scale and scope of the family\u2019s offshore financial empire is eventually revealed, this pact is likely to be strained and even contested. As John Heathershaw and I argued in our book,\u00a0 Dictators Without Borders , when Central Asian autocrats consolidated power in their home countries in the 1990s, they took advantage of global financial liberalization and the rise of offshore banking and shell companies to export the enormous fortunes they amassed through the privatization and acquisition of state-operated assets. When some former regime insiders became political opponents and fled into exile, Central Asian governments pursued them and their fortunes abroad. As a result, power struggles in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries have for years been waged overseas through foreign arbitration hearings in far-flung courtrooms, tips and document leaks to foreign newspapers, and aggressive public relations campaigns.\u00a0 In 2013,  Forbes  estimated the fortune of Nazarbayev\u2019s eldest daughter, Dariga Nazarbayeva, at $595 million. Nazarbayev\u2019s middle daughter, Dinara Kulibayeva, and her husband, Timur Kulibayev, made the magazine\u2019s billionaires list in 2021. The Nazarbayev daughters\u2019 fortunes, like those of other Kazakh oligarchs, are distributed globally and often held in luxury real estate. A recent Chatham House report found that Kazakh oligarchs own more than \u00a3500 million ($628 million) in central London real estate, most of it purchased via companies registered offshore. Over \u00a3330 million ($414 million) of these properties\u2014including the 221B Baker Street address made famous by its onetime fictional tenant, Sherlock Holmes\u2014are believed to belong to the Nazarbayevs themselves. In 2007, British media reported\u00a0that Kulibayev had purchased the Duke of York\u2019s Sunninghill estate for \u00a315 million ($22 million). In 2020 a Radio Free Europe investigation identified over $250 million in property belonging to Nazarbayev family members in the Czech Republic, France, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. Investigations into the extent of Nazarbayev\u2019s own holdings are just beginning to bear fruit. The OCCRP revealed in January that Nazarbayev personally controls four private foundations containing a combined $8 billion in assets\u2014including foreign bonds, regional banks, telecoms, shopping centers, hotels, and even a private jet\u2014all purchased through holding companies registered in the United Kingdom and Luxembourg. One of these, the Nazarbayev Foundation, states that its primary purpose is to support education at Nazarbayev University, in Astana. Unlike most university endowments, however, the foundation does not publish annual reports, lists no trustees, and provides no information on external donations, though it has been infused with billions in state capital. Despite their nonprofit status, the report observes, these foundations \u201cactually own larger business portfolios than many multinational conglomerates.\u201d In the 1990s, Nazarbayev was found to be the recipient of a series of bribes funneled via a network of Swiss bank accounts on behalf of major Western oil companies. In 2013, a  Wall Street Journal  investigation implicated Kulibayev in a kickback scandal involving the China National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s acquisition of a portion of a Kazakh state energy company. In 2020, the  Financial Times  published a series of documents revealing Kulibayev\u2019s complex and highly lucrative manipulation of intermediary companies involved in the construction of the China-Central Asia pipeline. And a previous OCCRP investigation found that two wealthy Nazarbayev cronies had funneled $30 million via offshore networks to Nazarbayev\u2019s unofficial third wife, Assel Kurmanbayeva. Ironically, as Tokayev prepares to wage a global campaign to reclaim Kazakhstan\u2019s stolen wealth, he will likely draw on his government\u2019s experiences pursuing exiled political dissidents and regime insiders-turned-whistleblowers. These include an aggressive campaign against Nazarbayev\u2019s former son-in-law, Rakhat Aliyev, who died under mysterious circumstances\u00a0in an Austrian jail in 2015 while awaiting extradition to Kazakhstan. Similarly, the Kazakh government has spent hundreds of millions pursuing the global holdings of Mukhtar Ablyazov, a former chair of Kazakhstan\u2019s BTA Bank who eventually became an exiled opposition leader. According to Kazakh authorities, Ablyazov embezzled billions\u00a0before fleeing Kazakhstan for political asylum\u00a0in France. The Kazakh government\u2019s pursuit of Ablyazov sparked global outrage in 2013 when Italian police seized Ablyazov\u2019s wife and six-year-old daughter from their home in Rome and returned them to Kazakhstan on a private jet under the watchful eye of the Kazakh ambassador\u2014an operation that a group of UN experts later characterized as an \"extraordinary rendition.\" \u00a0Whether the strategies Kazakhstan uses to root out the Nazarbayevs\u2019 global financial holdings ultimately involve such tactics remains to be seen. They will certainly be complex, expensive efforts involving dozens of lawyers, forensic accountants, investigators, and public relations specialists. If they fail, or simply drag on, the Nazarbayevs will be all too aware that few parts of the world are safe from the long arm of the Kazakh state and the security services they helped create. For the United States and the United Kingdom, which have experience handling corruption allegations involving Kazakhstan\u2019s ruling elite, the Tokayev government\u2019s battle to recover the country\u2019s stolen wealth provides an opportunity to test the effectiveness of their new anticorruption initiatives. In December 2021, the Biden administration unveiled a new strategy for fighting corruption, which it had repeatedly identified as a national security priority for the United States. The\u00a0strategy is notable in that it targets both foreign kleptocrats and their American enablers who use their professional expertise to assist with the laundering of money and reputations. But the policy itself gives little guidance as to how, operationally, anticorruption efforts can be integrated into foreign policy planning, especially when confronting the thorny issue of one autocratic government going after former autocratic elites. This is a different problem than the attempts to interfere in sensitive anticorruption investigations that U.S. officials have confronted with depressing regularity. In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice began investigating James Giffen, an American businessman who served as Nazarbayev\u2019s economic adviser, for allegedly funneling millions in payments from American oil companies into Swiss bank accounts on behalf of Kazakh officials. Despite Nazarbayev\u2019s persistent lobbying, the George W. Bush administration, much to its credit, refused to interfere in the case. The Department of Justice arrested Giffen in 2003 and charged him with bribery. (Ultimately, Giffen escaped with a small fine after the presiding judge accepted his claims that he had acted in Kazakhstan on behalf of U.S. government interests.) The task at hand, as Kazakhstan launches a global effort to recover its stolen assets, is trickier. The coming challenge for the United States will be about how to integrate work on new anticorruption directives with work on other U.S. foreign policy goals. By sanctioning or pursuing the Nazarbayev family\u2019s overseas assets, the United States may be demonstrating its commitment to fighting corruption, but it would be doing so in support of a Kazakh government whose commitment to political reform it cannot yet fully trust. Anticorruption interventions overseas can have profound political consequences for the countries involved. Over the last decade, for example, three international telecommunications firms operating in Uzbekistan have been fined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for attempting to bribe  Gulnara Karimova , the powerful daughter of former President Islam Karimov, in their quest for access to the country\u2019s lucrative cell phone market. The fines and global investigations proved highly damaging to Karimova politically, leading to the Uzbek government\u2019s arrest of Karimova and her associates in Uzbekistan. U.S. officials considering action to repatriate Kazakh government assets should take steps to ensure that the Tokayev government will transparently deposit the funds in an earmarked account that can be dedicated to supporting Kazakhstan\u2019s fledgling civil society\u2014including its anticorruption watchdogs and investigative journalists\u2014and anticorruption educational programs and training for civil servants. The United Kingdom has also introduced several new anticorruption tools that could speed the repatriation of Kazakhstan\u2019s stolen assets. Last year, Dariga Nazarbayeva  successfully fought  an unexplained wealth order by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency, which had frozen over\u00a0\u00a380 million ($100 million) worth of luxury properties she owned. In deciding the case in her favor, the British judge argued that Kazakhstan\u2019s prosecutor general\u2019s office had backed Nazarbayeva\u2019s claim that the origins of her wealth were not improper. A change in the Kazakh government\u2019s posture toward Nazarbayev family members and associates could make the outcome of similar future actions quite different. The former Kazakh president spent years obsessing over his overseas reputation and spent significant sums on burnishing his image abroad. Reputable Western institutions willingly promoted the narrative that Nazarbayev was a skillful steward of Kazakhstan\u2019s independence and sovereignty. Most conceded privately that he was an autocrat, but the \u201c soft authoritarianism \u201d associated with Nazarbayev\u2019s cosmopolitan public image was then considered the price for maintaining political stability and friendly relations. The range of Western actors complicit in building the myth of Nazarbayev is long: Western think tanks gratefully accepted millions in Kazakh funding, held events that celebrated U.S.-Kazakh relations, and downplayed the regime\u2019s poor human rights record. Administrators at prestigious universities were happy to forge high-profile partnerships with Nazarbayev University without questioning the origins or opaque governance of the foundation that funded them. The Kazakh government successfully retained high-priced U.S.\u00a0and European lobbyists and advisers to project an image of an enlightened despotism that aspired to ensuring political stability with some openness to the world. In Kazakhstan, popular discontent with the government\u2019s lack of reforms continues to simmer. Tokayev\u2019s turn to Russia for peacekeepers appears to have left him uncomfortably indebted to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The war in Ukraine has forced Kazakh officials into an uneasy neutrality\u2014avoiding condemnation of Putin\u2019s invasion in public and in United Nations votes, but sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Tokayev resisted Russian pressures to send troops, yet Kazakh officials are alarmed about the impact of Western sanctions. One survey of Kazakh public attitudes found backing for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u00ad\u2014the likely result of Russian state media coverage\u2014with another\u00a0suggesting considerably more support for Russia\u2019s war aims to protect the Donbas among Kazakhstan\u2019s smaller self-identified Russian population than among the 70 percent who claim a Kazakh ethnic identity, raising the prospect that the country\u2019s own internal ethnic balance could become a geopolitical fault line. The global campaign to reclaim Kazakh wealth and rid Kazakh institutions of Nazarbayev\u2019s influence is underway, but it is likely to implicate a greater and more varied group of international actors than even the most impassioned critics of Nazarbayev could ever have imagined.

Despite their nonprofit status, the report observes, these foundations \u201cactually own larger business portfolios than many multinational conglomerates.\u201d@@In the 1990s, Nazarbayev was found to be the recipient of a series of bribes funneled via a network of Swiss bank accounts on behalf of major Western oil companies. In 2013, a @@ investigation implicated Kulibayev in a kickback scandal involving the China National Petroleum Corporation\u2019s acquisition of a portion of a Kazakh state energy company. In 2020, the @@ published a series of documents revealing Kulibayev\u2019s complex and highly lucrative manipulation of intermediary companies involved in the construction of the China-Central Asia pipeline. And a previous OCCRP investigation found that two wealthy Nazarbayev cronies had funneled $30 million via offshore networks to Nazarbayev\u2019s unofficial third wife, Assel Kurmanbayeva.@@Ironically, as Tokayev prepares to wage a global campaign to reclaim Kazakhstan\u2019s stolen wealth, he will likely draw on his government\u2019s experiences pursuing exiled political dissidents and regime insiders-turned-whistleblowers. These include an aggressive campaign against Nazarbayev\u2019s former son-in-law, Rakhat Aliyev, who died under mysterious circumstances\u00a0in an Austrian jail in 2015 while awaiting extradition to Kazakhstan. Similarly, the Kazakh government has spent hundreds of millions pursuing the global holdings of Mukhtar Ablyazov, a former chair of Kazakhstan\u2019s BTA Bank who eventually became an exiled opposition leader. According to Kazakh authorities, Ablyazov embezzled billions\u00a0before fleeing Kazakhstan for political asylum\u00a0in France.@@The Kazakh government\u2019s pursuit of Ablyazov sparked global outrage in 2013 when Italian police seized Ablyazov\u2019s wife and six-year-old daughter from their home in Rome and returned them to Kazakhstan on a private jet under the watchful eye of the Kazakh ambassador\u2014an operation that a group of UN experts later characterized as an \"extraordinary rendition.\" \u00a0Whether the strategies Kazakhstan uses to root out the Nazarbayevs\u2019 global financial holdings ultimately involve such tactics remains to be seen. They will certainly be complex, expensive efforts involving dozens of lawyers, forensic accountants, investigators, and public relations specialists. If they fail, or simply drag on, the Nazarbayevs will be all too aware that few parts of the world are safe from the long arm of the Kazakh state and the security services they helped create.@@For the United States and the United Kingdom, which have experience handling corruption allegations involving Kazakhstan\u2019s ruling elite, the Tokayev government\u2019s battle to recover the country\u2019s stolen wealth provides an opportunity to test the effectiveness of their new anticorruption initiatives.@@In December 2021, the Biden administration unveiled a new strategy for fighting corruption, which it had repeatedly identified as a national security priority for the United States. The\u00a0strategy is notable in that it targets both foreign kleptocrats and their American enablers who use their professional expertise to assist with the laundering of money and reputations. But the policy itself gives little guidance as to how, operationally, anticorruption efforts can be integrated into foreign policy planning, especially when confronting the thorny issue of one autocratic government going after former autocratic elites.@@This is a different problem than the attempts to interfere in sensitive anticorruption investigations that U.S. officials have confronted with depressing regularity. In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice began investigating James Giffen, an American businessman who served as Nazarbayev\u2019s economic adviser, for allegedly funneling millions in payments from American oil companies into Swiss bank accounts on behalf of Kazakh officials. Despite Nazarbayev\u2019s persistent lobbying, the George W. Bush administration, much to its credit, refused to interfere in the case. The Department of Justice arrested Giffen in 2003 and charged him with bribery. (Ultimately, Giffen escaped with a small fine after the presiding judge accepted his claims that he had acted in Kazakhstan on behalf of U.S. government interests.)@@The task at hand, as Kazakhstan launches a global effort to recover its stolen assets, is trickier. The coming challenge for the United States will be about how to integrate work on new anticorruption directives with work on other U.S. foreign policy goals. By sanctioning or pursuing the Nazarbayev family\u2019s overseas assets, the United States may be demonstrating its commitment to fighting corruption, but it would be doing so in support of a Kazakh government whose commitment to political reform it cannot yet fully trust.@@Anticorruption interventions overseas can have profound political consequences for the countries involved. Over the last decade, for example, three international telecommunications firms operating in Uzbekistan have been fined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for attempting to bribe @@, the powerful daughter of former President Islam Karimov, in their quest for access to the country\u2019s lucrative cell phone market. The fines and global investigations proved highly damaging to Karimova politically, leading to the Uzbek government\u2019s arrest of Karimova and her associates in Uzbekistan. U.S. officials considering action to repatriate Kazakh government assets should take steps to ensure that the Tokayev government will transparently deposit the funds in an earmarked account that can be dedicated to supporting Kazakhstan\u2019s fledgling civil society\u2014including its anticorruption watchdogs and investigative journalists\u2014and anticorruption educational programs and training for civil servants.@@The United Kingdom has also introduced several new anticorruption tools that could speed the repatriation of Kazakhstan\u2019s stolen assets. Last year, Dariga Nazarbayeva @@ an unexplained wealth order by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Crime Agency, which had frozen over\u00a0\u00a380 million ($100 million) worth of luxury properties she owned. In deciding the case in her favor, the British judge argued that Kazakhstan\u2019s prosecutor general\u2019s office had backed Nazarbayeva\u2019s claim that the origins of her wealth were not improper. A change in the Kazakh government\u2019s posture toward Nazarbayev family members and associates could make the outcome of similar future actions quite different.@@The former Kazakh president spent years obsessing over his overseas reputation and spent significant sums on burnishing his image abroad. Reputable Western institutions willingly promoted the narrative that Nazarbayev was a skillful steward of Kazakhstan\u2019s independence and sovereignty. Most conceded privately that he was an autocrat, but the \u201c@@\u201d associated with Nazarbayev\u2019s cosmopolitan public image was then considered the price for maintaining political stability and friendly relations.@@The range of Western actors complicit in building the myth of Nazarbayev is long: Western think tanks gratefully accepted millions in Kazakh funding, held events that celebrated U.S.-Kazakh relations, and downplayed the regime\u2019s poor human rights record. Administrators at prestigious universities were happy to forge high-profile partnerships with Nazarbayev University without questioning the origins or opaque governance of the foundation that funded them. The Kazakh government successfully retained high-priced U.S.\u00a0and European lobbyists and advisers to project an image of an enlightened despotism that aspired to ensuring political stability with some openness to the world.@@In Kazakhstan, popular discontent with the government\u2019s lack of reforms continues to simmer. Tokayev\u2019s turn to Russia for peacekeepers appears to have left him uncomfortably indebted to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The war in Ukraine has forced Kazakh officials into an uneasy neutrality\u2014avoiding condemnation of Putin\u2019s invasion in public and in United Nations votes, but sending humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Tokayev resisted Russian pressures to send troops, yet Kazakh officials are alarmed about the impact of Western sanctions. One survey of Kazakh public attitudes found backing for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\u00ad\u2014the likely result of Russian state media coverage\u2014with another\u00a0suggesting considerably more support for Russia\u2019s war aims to protect the Donbas among Kazakhstan\u2019s smaller self-identified Russian population than among the 70 percent who claim a Kazakh ethnic identity, raising the prospect that the country\u2019s own internal ethnic balance could become a geopolitical fault line. The global campaign to reclaim Kazakh wealth and rid Kazakh institutions of Nazarbayev\u2019s influence is underway, but it is likely to implicate a greater and more varied group of international actors than even the most impassioned critics of Nazarbayev could ever have imagined.", "download_timeout": 180.0, "download_slot": "www.foreignaffairs.com", "download_latency": 0.25998806953430176,

approach to the world. Since taking office, U.S. President Joe Biden has argued that the struggle between democracy and autocracy is the defining clash of our time, even as critics and some members of his administration haven\u2019t always agreed. For Biden, at least, the Russian invasion and the world\u2019s response to it has proved that he was right all along.  In his State of Union address in early March, Biden described the war in Ukraine as a battle between freedom and tyranny. In Warsaw a few weeks later, in another speech replete with Cold War echoes, the president announced that Washington would lead the free world to victory in a great struggle \u201cbetween democracy and autocracy, between liberty and repression, between a rules-based order and one governed by brute force.\u201d Biden has good reason to be hitting these themes hard. The Russian invasion has shown how deeply the struggle to shape global order is rooted in opposing conceptions of  domestic order . It has clarified and intensified the struggle between advanced democracies and Eurasian autocracies. And it has given Biden\u2019s foreign policy, which seemed headed for frustration if not outright failure just a few months ago, a new lease on life. Yet critics of the democracy-autocracy thesis aren\u2019t wrong to argue that the world isn\u2019t quite so simple. Winning this contest of systems will require crafting a strategy that takes these complexities into account.  Biden must first specify what Washington opposes\u2014not the existence of autocracy but that combination of tyranny, power, and hostility that so threatens the United States and the international order it has built. He must then flesh out his concept of the \u201cfree world,\u201d a familiar term that can be more flexible than it sounds. Finally, his administration must address four key problems that this framing implies. A free-world strategy can help Washington prevent this century from becoming an age of autocratic advantage\u2014but it raises pointed questions about who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out, and how to navigate a world that is increasingly divided and stubbornly interdependent at the same time.  SECOND CHANCES Biden\u2019s foreign policy has unfolded in three stages. The first six months of the administration showcased bold ideas and big plans. Biden came into office stressing the ideological roots of great-power rivalry and the need to strengthen the cohesion and resilience of the  democratic world . His administration soothed alliances that had been strained during the Trump era; it cultivated democratic cooperation on issues from semiconductor supply chains to stability in the western Pacific. Biden focused NATO and the Group of 7 on the China challenge; he raised the ambitions and expanded the activities of the Quad, a group that comprises Australia, India, Japan, and the United States; he pursued new schemes, such as the AUKUS security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, that connected democratic allies in creative ways.  \u201c America \u00a0 is \u00a0 back ,\u201d Biden claimed: a\u00a0confident superpower was reasserting principled international leadership. Then the next six months got very ugly. The ill-managed U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan delivered the citizens of that country to a brutal tyranny. Biden\u2019s China agenda stagnated in the absence of any compelling trade policy for the Indo-Pacific; his \u201cAsia first\u201d approach foundered amid worsening tensions with Iran and Russia. The major democracy-themed initiative\u2014the Summit for Democracy\u2014was a glitchy, underwhelming Zoom meeting. Meanwhile, much of Biden\u2019s domestic agenda\u2014meant to build a \u201csituation of strength\u201d at home through ambitious reform\u2014stalled in Congress while galloping inflation created domestic weakness instead.  Stage three initially looked even worse. By early 2022, U.S. officials were warning that Russian President  Vladimir Putin  would soon invade Ukraine and that he could easily conquer most of the country. In the run-up to the conflict, Washington adeptly revealed Russia\u2019s plans through the rapid dissemination of sensitive intelligence. Yet it nonetheless struggled to deter Putin or secure transatlantic agreement on a punishing sanctions package, in part because of residual European skepticism that the assault would indeed occur. The administration was confronting the possibility that a frontline democratic state would be destroyed by an imperialist autocracy, creating cascading global insecurity and a pervasive sense that the dictators were on the march.  Yet Ukrainian resistance, Russian blunders, timely American support, and surprising European unity   have  saved that country \u2014and with it, Biden\u2019s foreign policy. Shocked by the brazenness of the attack, a transregional coalition of democracies slapped harsh sanctions on Putin. The United States and European allies turned the tables on Moscow, providing money, guns, and intelligence that helped Ukraine defend itself and take a terrible toll on the invaders. The world\u2019s premier alliance of democracies, NATO, is strengthening its military capabilities and preparing to take on  new members ; countries in the Indo-Pacific are moving faster, if not fast enough, to meet the parallel challenge from China. Putin\u2019s invasion produced greater unity and urgency among the advanced democracies than at any time in decades. It also has largely, but not wholly, vindicated Biden\u2019s democracy-versus-autocracy framing.  A WORLD (MOSTLY) DIVIDED The war in Ukraine has certainly confirmed that regime type is a crucial driver of international behavior. Russia\u2019s policies flow from a witch\u2019s brew of history, geopolitics, personality, and ideology, but autocracy and aggression undoubtedly go together in Putin\u2019s regime. A democratic Russia would not feel so threatened by a democratic, Western-facing Ukraine. A consolidated, modern democracy would not systematically commit war crimes as an act of policy, seize and annex a neighbor\u2019s territory, and lie, shamelessly and continuously, to its population and the world.  The war has also reminded us, therefore, how profoundly the world would change if it were run by revisionist autocracies. Yes, the hypocrisies of the liberal international order are legion; dictators have no monopoly on deception and coercion. Yet in a system that was not led by Washington or another democratic superpower, the aggressive, flagrantly acquisitive action Putin has taken in Ukraine, and that Beijing has taken in the South China Sea, would be far more common. Great-power predation\u2014economic, diplomatic, military\u2014would be the norm the world endures rather than the exception it has the luxury of criticizing. The type of global order a great power pursues is the outward projection of its political order  at home .  The war, then, has both highlighted and deepened the fundamental global cleavage today\u2014the clash between advanced democracies that are committed  to the existing international order and the Eurasian autocracies trying to overturn it. Regional aggression is starting to elicit global democratic responses. The coalition that has sanctioned Russia includes not just the United States and Europe but also Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan\u2014just as European powers are asserting their interest in preventing China from dominating the  western Pacific .  At the same time, the world\u2019s two great autocracies are joining hands. A war that began weeks after Russia and China touted a relationship with \u201cno limits\u201d will surely produce an even tighter axis, since neither country, having alienated much of the democratic world, has anywhere else to go for now. And that, in turn, will further encourage democracies at both ends of Eurasia and beyond to cooperate in confronting an emerging illiberal coalition. Biden may say that Washington wishes to avoid a world of opposing blocs, but that is precisely the thrust of global events and U.S. policy.  Yet the \u201cclash of systems\u201d model doesn\u2019t explain everything. If most advanced democracies have rallied, many developing democracies have not. India and Brazil have adopted a position of neutrality. Countries in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia have sought a middle ground. There are always specific reasons, such as  India\u2019s  dependence on Russian arms or Brazil\u2019s reliance on Russian fertilizer. Yet this new nonaligned movement is a reminder that many of the United States\u2019 democratic brethren are choosing not to choose.  Moreover, the Biden administration is rediscovering its reliance on nondemocracies. Perhaps one day a green energy revolution will make the petrostates irrelevant, but for now Washington needs Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies to offset the energy shock the war has caused. Containing Russia and China will require the cooperation of countries\u2014including Singapore, Turkey, and Vietnam\u2014that are governed in illiberal ways. The United States isn\u2019t opposed to all autocracies, and not all democracies are fully on its side.  Finally, the  war in Ukraine  has shown the perils of interdependence with hostile regimes\u2014but that interdependence isn\u2019t going away. The advanced democracies can brutalize Russia economically, but they can\u2019t\u2014at a tolerable cost\u2014totally sever it from the world. They can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, come anywhere close to a complete decoupling from China. Freedom-versus-tyranny rhetoric brings to mind a global landscape fully split in two. But we live in a world where two increasingly hostile camps cannot fully escape each other\u2019s economic and technological embrace.  THE PYRAMID  If Biden intends to pursue a free-world strategy, his first task is to clarify what, exactly, the United States opposes. The answer is not autocracy per se, given that Washington must work with some illiberal regimes to check others. What the United States opposes is the marriage of tyranny, power, and hostility: those authoritarian regimes that have the intent and the ability to fundamentally challenge the existing  international system , by exporting the violence and illiberalism they practice at home to the world.  This behavior can take the form of outright territorial aggression, whether blatant or subtle; it can involve economic and political coercion meant to distort the foreign policies and domestic politics of other nations. It can involve meddling and subversion that impairs the functioning of democratic societies, transnational repression that can chill basic liberties globally, or efforts to weaponize new technologies in ways that could drastically shift the balance of power or the balance of freedom and oppression. Different behaviors will, of course, merit different responses. But it is this combination of autocracy, capability, and aggressive conduct that the free world must organize itself to meet.  Which means that Biden must also better articulate the coalition he aims to rally. The free world is a Cold War\u2013era concept making a comeback. The original phrase, though, was more malleable than we often remember. It included liberal democracies, friendly authoritarians, and states of various shades in between. Today, the free world is best thought of as a three-tiered coalition.  The first tier features the United States\u2019 democratic treaty allies\u2014the (mostly) liberal democracies that make up the Anglosphere, the transatlantic community, and the strongest links in the chain of U.S. alliances in the Indo-Pacific. This group features deep, institutionalized cooperation based on shared values as well as shared interests; it constitutes the core of any coalition to resist aggression, maintain democratic technological dominance, and otherwise thwart the autocratic challenge. And although U.S. alliances are organized regionally or bilaterally, they create preponderant global strength: including the United States, this group commands a majority of world GDP and military spending. The key, then, will be not simply enhancing capabilities and collaboration within existing alliances but also forging greater connections across them, as  AUKUS  has done.  The second tier includes democratic partners. These countries are often imperfectly or inconsistently aligned with the United States. They are far from wholly comfortable with American power. Yet they would surely be far less comfortable still in a world where expansionist autocracies had the advantage, so they will lend critical assistance on select matters. India may be hesitant to break with Russia, but it is already a vital part of the geopolitical and technological balancing effort vis-\u00e0-vis China. Indonesia will increasingly cooperate with Washington on security issues, even as it maintains close commercial ties to Beijing. Ukraine and Taiwan are non-allies that constitute geopolitical bulwarks in crucial regions. Biden\u2019s goal should be to further develop institutions and arrangements, such as  the Quad  or various tech alliances, that enhance the overall power of the free world by thickening the connective tissue between its first and second tiers.  The third tier consists of comparatively benign autocracies\u2014illiberal countries that still support an international system led by a democratic superpower. Admittedly, efforts to draw distinctions between good and bad dictators have a sordid lineage. But certain autocracies do depend on an open, U.S.-led global economy; occupy strategic geography that leaves them vulnerable to Beijing or Moscow and thus dependent on Washington; or are otherwise deeply wired into the existing system. These countries, such as Vietnam and Singapore, will work with the United States on a transactional basis, to thwart more extreme forms of autocratic aggression. But their dealings with democracies will be more attenuated when it comes to human rights, the future of the Internet, and other governance issues.  ROCKY ROAD TO \u2026 WHERE?  A free-world strategy can thus be principled without being absolutist or self-defeating. It offers a plausible rationale for working with some autocrats against others. And it packs a strategic punch: a free-world coalition can allow the United States and its friends to marshal a decisive superiority on critical issues. Nonetheless, challenges abound.  The first involves managing interdependence in a fragmenting world. The goal here should be not to fully unwind those ties but to ensure that the  terms  of interdependence favor the free world. This will require selective decoupling\u2014denying Chinese firms access to investment and high-tech inputs, for instance, or increasing Europe\u2019s freedom of action by weaning it off  Russian energy  supplies. More important will be increasing the commercial, financial, and technological cohesion of the free world, to accelerate its growth and innovation and decrease its vulnerability to autocratic coercion. This is urgent: China is racing to reduce its susceptibility to international economic pressure, in recognition that the terms of interdependence may determine the balance of leverage in a crisis.  A separate challenge is engaging ambivalent, democratic partners, countries that cooperate with Washington on concrete issues but don\u2019t particularly like the free-world model. The United States will need different rhetoric for different audiences: self-determination and freedom of geopolitical choice may sell better than democracy-versus-tyranny in Africa or Southeast Asia. Washington should carefully prioritize what it needs from these partners, whose choice of 5G telecommunications provider may be more important than their position on Ukraine. Yet Biden must also exploit opportunities the war has provided. India\u2019s strategy of using Russian arms to protect itself against China is now bankrupt: if Moscow is crippled by conflict and sanctions, and ever more dependent on Beijing, then it can\u2019t or won\u2019t provide Delhi with the military equipment it might need in a crisis. By helping India reduce its reliance on Russian military gear, the United States and other democratic countries can also reduce India\u2019s incentives for hedging over time.  A free-world strategy also has awkward implications for estranged autocratic partners. After all, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates do engage in transnational repression, weaponize surveillance technologies, and coerce their neighbors. Both have pulled closer to Russia and China, in part for economic reasons, in part because of a declining U.S. interest in Persian Gulf security, and in part because strongmen have an ideological affinity for other strongmen. Both countries still have long-standing, extensive ties to the United States, with whom they share an interest in containing Iran; their relationships with Washington are valuable enough that they won\u2019t crumble overnight. But one possible upshot of a more starkly divided world is that the most important Gulf monarchies could end up on the other side.  Even if a green revolution eventually turns Riyadh and Abu Dhabi into has-beens\u2014a big \u201cif\u201d\u2014in the medium term this could lead to nasty strategic consequences in a region that still matters very much. For the time being, then, a free-world strategy can\u2019t liberate the United States from ongoing engagement, and perhaps ticklish compromises, with key autocracies that have a foot in both camps. Finally, Biden should answer a question he has avoided so far: How does this end? A free-world strategy doesn\u2019t require a goal of regime change, although Biden\u2019s ad-libbed comments about Putin haven\u2019t clarified the issue. Democracies can moderate tensions with hostile autocracies, as d\u00e9tente showed during the Cold War. But if this is really a contest between countries with fundamentally different worldviews based on fundamentally different domestic orders, then such a d\u00e9tente will, once again, be temporary. The United States spent decades trying to draw Moscow and Beijing into the international system; now it must strengthen the free world around them, and reduce their ability to do harm, until their internal politics shift or their power fades. A free-world strategy can eventually produce a happy ending. But \u201ceventually\u201d may be a very long time. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

Trump\u2019s economic wars. Biden\u2019s rhetoric is less extreme and more polite, but his policies nevertheless channel his predecessor\u2019s harsh isolationism: he has maintained sky-high tariffs on imports from China, preserved quotas on imports of steel and aluminum, and kept tariffs on imported washing machines.  In a climate of  steep inflation , these policies impose real costs. Tariff-induced price increases are passed on to consumers and businesses through higher domestic costs for imported goods, resulting in more expensive clothes, footwear, dairy products, and other goods for everyday Americans. These additional costs aren\u2019t an academic fiction; they take real money out of real consumers\u2019 pockets.  Such pain calls for a change in policy. Economic protectionism may not have caused the recent bout of inflation in the United States, but removing or reducing tariffs could help end it. A two percentage point reduction in import barriers across a broad array of goods could reduce inflation by around 1.3 percentage points, saving the average U.S. household nearly $800 over the next year. Biden has said his \u201ctop priority is getting prices under control.\u201d If he is serious about doing so, he should start by removing tariff and nontariff trade barriers. NEW ADMINISTRATION, SAME PROTECTIONISM Biden has done more than maintain Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies.  In addition to continuing  his predecessor\u2019s  trade war tariffs, Biden has doubled down on so-called Buy America restrictions\u2014rules that wall off federal purchases from foreign competition \u2014 cloaking his actions in the mantle of patriotism. Such policies signal that foreign firms, even those based in NATO countries, are unwelcome suppliers not just for the U.S. government but for ordinary American consumers. Biden has also failed to waive the Jones Act\u2014a payoff to the U.S. Merchant Marine that prevents foreign vessels from carrying merchandise between U.S. ports\u2014thereby imposing high shipping costs on Hawaiian and Puerto Rican families and worsening shipping congestion.  Biden\u2019s protectionist bent also informs his administration\u2019s China policy. At a press conference in May, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that some Trump-era tariffs on Chinese imports \u201cimpose more harm on consumers and businesses\u201d and do little to further U.S. interests. Yet U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai has consistently emphasized the need for a \u201cdurable, effective strategy\u201d to compete with China, one that includes tariffs. Compounding the issue is the insistence by some politicians, such as Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley, that any trade with China is unpatriotic, with no distinction drawn between pillowcases and high-tech lasers.   Economic protectionism may not have caused inflation, but removing tariffs could help end it. Unfortunately, Biden\u2019s opposition to free trade coincides with the highest inflation rate in decades, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain woes, and soaring  energy costs . Global fertilizer prices, for example, have more than doubled from a year ago. World steel prices reached historic highs last year and could rise even further since Russia destroyed Ukraine\u2019s giant Azovstal plant and sanctions placed Moscow\u2019s exports squarely behind a Western embargo.  Trump\u2019s\u2014and now Biden\u2019s\u2014steel tariffs and quotas will only add to inflation by raising the price of automobiles, refrigerators, plumbing fixtures, bridges, and much more. Although domestic steel makers may insist that such tariffs protect U.S. jobs, American steel users pay  an extra $650,000  per year for every steel job saved\u2014an unacceptable cost. Meanwhile, penalty duties on Canadian lumber add an extra  $18,600  to the price of the average newly constructed U.S. home. Between 2017 and 2021, lumber imports from Canada plummeted from $5.9 billion to $185 million. The list goes on.  Even carve-outs designed to address foreign complaints about U.S. protectionism have made little difference. Some countries have successfully negotiated permanent exemptions from U.S.  steel  and aluminum tariffs in exchange for limits on other exports to the United States, but such quotas do little to increase the supply of raw materials available to U.S. steel-using industries. Brazil and South Korea, for example, agreed to quotas in 2018, but their steel exports to the United States remain well below pre-tariff levels.  TRADE AND INFLATION Given the  economic costs  of protectionism, trade liberalization must be a central part of any anti-inflation policy. After all, cutting tariffs and removing import quotas will lower the costs of imported goods purchased by U.S. firms and households. At the same time, cheaper foreign goods will put downward pressure on domestic prices for competing merchandise. Since low-income households consume a larger proportion of their earnings than high-income households, any tariff reduction would also disproportionately benefit the most vulnerable U.S. families. A good place to start is with the equivalent of a two-percentage point tariff reduction, which could reduce inflation by roughly 1.3 percentage points over the next year. To achieve this goal, Biden should eliminate nearly all of Trump\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum and Chinese imports. Biden should also provide emergency relief from duties on key products such as fertilizer and lumber. Although a 1.3 percentage point reduction might seem small while inflation rages at 8.3 percent, the relief would not be trivial. In concrete terms, the average U.S. household would save an additional $800 over the next year. And in more normal years, when inflation is running near the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual target of two percent, a 1.3 percentage point reduction would be significant.  But the Biden administration could be even more ambitious. If Washington took additional measures, including relaxing Buy America restrictions and lowering peak most-favored-nation (MFN) tariffs\u2014those above 20 percent\u2014to a maximum of ten percent, it could reduce the average tariff burden by  4.2 percentage points  and decrease inflation by two percentage points, all while still leaving many barriers in place. In particular, our analysis assumes that the United States will retain its limits on imported services\u2014for instance, requiring foreign professionals to undergo onerous licensing processes and preventing foreign ships from transporting merchandise between U.S. ports. Although such barriers sharply raise the price of many vital services, the current political climate would make it extremely difficult to eliminate them.  The value of tackling trade protectionism is obvious. Moreover, if  Biden  wants to deliver quick relief for consumers, he could prioritize reducing tariffs on imported goods that figure prominently in household expenditures, including   dairy products, clothing, and footwear. By capping MFN tariffs on these products at ten percent, Biden could visibly lower advertised prices for everyday merchandise sold by Amazon, Walmart, and other major retail outlets. Again, such a policy would primarily benefit low-income households since they spend a higher share of their income on basic goods. Separately, Biden could ask Congress for authority to suspend tariffs or duties for 18 months on any product that the president determines is in short supply, starting with infant formula, fertilizer, and lumber.\u00a0To assuage legislative-branch fears about an executive power grab, the law could automatically expire if annual inflation drops below three percent within 18 months and contain a provision allowing Congress to override the president. Taken together, these policies would burnish Biden\u2019s anti-inflation credentials and be welcomed by U.S. consumers as prices drop at retail outlets. LIBERALIZE GEOPOLITICS Beyond combating inflation, trade liberalization can also serve U.S. geopolitical objectives. Protectionist  sentiments, for instance, will inevitably undermine two of Biden\u2019s major international initiatives: the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which aims to counter China\u2019s economic statecraft,   and the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC), which seeks to coordinate transatlantic policy on commercial issues. As long as domestic opposition to free trade takes new access to U.S. markets off the table in negotiations, these signature initiatives must increasingly rely on U.S. security commitments to encourage participation. This unspoken tradeoff may not work for countries that already have military alliances with the United States or for those that may not harbor acute fears of  Chinese expansion , such as Indonesia and Malaysia.\u00a0  With these practical constraints, the IPEF and TTC may well prove insufficient substitutes for existing trade and investment agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2014the agreement Trump ditched early in his presidency\u2014and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, China\u2019s lead entry in the regional trade sweepstakes. After all, Biden is asking foreign partners to accept U.S. norms on labor and minority rights, gender equality, environmental rules, public corruption, state-owned enterprises, artificial intelligence, digital practices, data privacy, and much more in exchange for little except broad and unspecified security assurances. This bargain may not sit well with domestic constituencies in partner countries more concerned about bread-and-butter issues than geopolitics.  Trade liberalization, by contrast, would open up a host of new possibilities. Biden could, for instance, offer concrete benefits to partners by lifting steel and aluminum tariffs and quotas, relaxing Buy America rules to expand market access in government procurement, or lowering dairy and clothing tariffs. Doing so would demonstrate political goodwill and enhance foreign support for U.S. initiatives. THE INEVITABLE BACKLASH Although eminently sensible in economic and geopolitical terms, trade liberalization will inevitably face challenges from business and labor groups. Beneficiaries of protectionism, after all, have strong allies in Congress and in the Biden administration. Biden himself described Buy America rules as a cornerstone of his foreign policy, and major U.S. corporations, particularly construction firms and defense contractors, stand to benefit from the rule\u2019s provisions. Still, relaxing such provisions could save the U.S. government and taxpayers an estimated $100 billion per year.  Similar savings would come from reducing steel tariffs, quotas, and a large array of penalty duties and tariff peaks. Advocates for protectionism oppose free trade in the name of \u201ceconomic resilience,\u201d but their policies come at a high cost\u2014one that is ultimately borne by average consumers. Either inflation is Biden\u2019s number one domestic priority or it is not. But if it is, the value of tackling trade protectionism is obvious.

Wade , the case that affirmed a constitutional right to abortion. Reversing  Roe  would have profound implications for abortion access in the United States. Such a decision would also have ramifications abroad, particularly if a judicial ruling empowers future U.S. presidential administrations to push for restrictions on abortion in other parts of the world. It is important, however, not to overstate U.S. influence on global abortion policy. The 1973 case was a landmark in allowing abortion access and served as an example to abortion advocates across the world. But in the 50 years since, the United States\u2019 international messaging on abortion has been incoherent. U.S. law made abortion legal at home, but additional legislation that followed gave U.S. presidential administrations tools to restrict access abroad. Indeed, the United States, with policies that are at worst obstructionist and at best inconsistent, has been instrumental in blocking international agreement on abortion liberalization. Nevertheless, the global trend has slowly moved toward greater access to abortion. Whatever the fate of  Roe  in the United States, other countries will decide their own abortion policies as they see fit. Countries such as France and the United Kingdom first established policies outlawing abortion in the early nineteenth century\u2014and replicated them around the world by declaring their own laws to be the laws of their colonies. But forces pushing policy in the opposite direction emerged not long after. In Europe in the early twentieth century, socialist parties pressed for exceptions to abortion bans, including for women suffering from poverty. The Soviet government was the first to legalize abortion on demand in 1920, although it periodically retracted and reinstated that policy over the following decades. Allowing abortion in limited circumstances gained broader public support across Europe when rates of abortion increased in the 1930s during the Great Depression. By the late 1960s, countries all over the world were moving toward liberalization. The United Kingdom passed the Abortion Act in 1967, Singapore approved its Abortion Act in 1969, India instituted the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act in 1971, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on  Roe v. Wade  in 1973. When  China  introduced the one-child policy in 1979, its implementation required access to abortion.\u00a0 The wave of abortion liberalization in the 1960s and 1970s coincided with a general rise in global attention to  women\u2019s rights  issues, such as equal employment opportunities, the criminalization of domestic violence, and nondiscrimination in property and inheritance laws. The United Nations declared 1975 to 1984 \u201cthe Decade of the Woman\u201d and in 1979 adopted a watershed women\u2019s rights treaty, the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which has since been signed by nearly every country in the world. But even as some countries included abortion access in domestic legislation, others objected to the practice, and strong countermobilization kept the issue out of international agreements. Abortion was not mentioned in the 1979 treaty, nor has it been included in the UN\u2019s Millennial Development Goals or the subsequent Sustainable Development Goals as a component of progress toward women\u2019s rights. At the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, too, the Catholic Church formed strategic alliances with the delegations of predominantly Catholic and Muslim countries to block efforts by women\u2019s rights organizations to add language addressing abortion to conference documents. The United States has long acted as a particularly effective spoiler in efforts to build a strong global consensus around abortion. The  Roe v. Wade  decision sparked an immediate backlash from the domestic anti-abortion movement, and the area where it managed to quickly gain traction was in U.S. foreign policy. Researchers have  documented  how, in the years leading up to the court ruling, the Republican Party used opposition to abortion to draw Catholic voters away from the Democratic Party and mobilize social conservatives to vote. Republicans received their first legislative win soon after President Richard Nixon was reelected in 1972. The same year that  Roe  was decided, in 1973, Congress passed the Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act, prohibiting the use of U.S. aid to pay for abortions.\u00a0 A decade later, in 1984, President Ronald Reagan sent a delegation to the Second International Conference on Population in Mexico City to announce a new policy, building on the Helms Amendment, that cut all U.S. family planning aid to nongovernmental organizations outside the United States that failed to certify that they were neither performing abortions nor providing any information about abortion. (This became known as the Mexico City Policy.) In 1985, the U.S. Congress passed the Kemp-Kasten Amendment, which imposed a similar restriction on U.S. contributions to the UN Population Fund. Together, these policies resulted in a substantial reduction in U.S. funding available to support comprehensive reproductive health services abroad. Although the policies apply to all recipients of U.S. aid, in practice, the poorest countries\u2014where people often depend on foreign-funded NGOs for health services\u2014are most affected.\u00a0 There are both moral and practical problems with U.S. policies on abortion access abroad. They represent a sort of imperialist hypocrisy, establishing a hierarchy in which a procedure that is legal in the United States is restricted for women living in other countries. Further,  research  has  consistently   found  that the Mexico City Policy increases rates of abortion, particularly among women living in countries that receive a lot of U.S. foreign aid. This outcome may seem counterintuitive, but the explanation is logical: when the policy has been enforced, the supply of contraceptives in those countries has declined because the NGOs that provide reproductive health services have lost funding. The result is less contraceptive use, which means more pregnancies and more abortions. What the Mexico City Policy does provide, however, is symbolic support to opponents of abortion. This and other U.S. policies have created a chilling effect on reproductive rights advocacy in countries reliant on U.S. aid. In interviews conducted by Vanessa Rios for a 2019 International Women\u2019s Health Coalition  study , representatives of health organizations in Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, and South Africa reported fear of working with or being affiliated in any way with other groups involved in abortion. They were even afraid to discuss abortion within their own organizations.\u00a0 The role of the Mexico City Policy in empowering anti-abortion movements helps counteract an important limit on its effectiveness: the fact that every Democratic president since 1984 has rescinded it for the length of his term in office. Although Democratic administrations have restored U.S. funding to aid organizations in other countries that have previously been cut off, those administrations typically have not enacted policies to disrupt anti-abortion networks or support reproductive rights advocacy in those places. Under President  Donald Trump , the United States sought even further restrictions on abortion abroad. In 2017, the administration expanded the Mexico City Policy to apply not just to the $600 million or so in aid that Washington allocates for family planning and reproductive health each year but to the roughly $7 billion in overall international health assistance that it provides every year. Rios\u2019s interviews suggested that some of these funds were diverted to support anti-abortion groups abroad\u2014and that conservative politicians and organizations in countries such as Kenya and Nigeria had become more outspoken in response to the change in U.S. policy.\u00a0 In 2020, the U.S. government, led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, co-sponsored (with Brazil, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, and Uganda) the Geneva Consensus Declaration on Promoting Women\u2019s Health and Strengthening the Family, which, while not binding its 34 signatories to any specific policies, expressed a shared commitment to preventing abortion access. The  authoritarian tendencies  of the participating countries are striking, especially in conjunction with the steps some have taken lately to restrict abortion, such as the Polish Constitutional Tribunal\u2019s 2020 decision limiting the circumstances in which the procedure is legal. Scholars have noted that the backsliding of democracy around the world may lead to further erosions of reproductive rights. To date, intermittent U.S. efforts to restrict abortion have not succeeded at reversing a wider global trend toward liberalization. Although some international institutions still shy away from addressing abortion, the World Health Organization, for example, has become an increasingly vocal advocate for abortion liberalization. It issued a report offering technical and policy guidance for safe abortion practices in 2003 and updated it in 2012. In 2019, the WHO moved mifepristone and misoprostol (the drugs in the two-pill regimen of a so-called medical abortion) to its Essential Medicines List, which outlines the minimum requirements for a national health-care system and identifies the safest and most effective medicines for priority conditions. Earlier this year, the WHO made its boldest statement on abortion yet, releasing abortion care guidelines that recommend countries decriminalize abortion and make the procedure available on request to pregnant people, presenting these policies as necessary to reduce unsafe abortions and maternal deaths. Many countries are trending toward removing abortion restrictions as well, albeit in an uneven and fragmented way. Wealthy countries tend to have liberal abortion laws, whereas their less wealthy counterparts have laws ranging from total prohibition to allowing abortion without restrictions. Since 1994, more than 50 countries have expanded the legal grounds for abortion. Only four\u2014the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Poland\u2014have made their abortion laws consistently more restrictive. Many factors have contributed to this trend. For one, the WHO\u2019s characterization of abortion as a maternal health issue rather than a moral and cultural issue has helped make the practice less controversial. In countries where doctors are a strong political force, they have pushed for decriminalization to give physicians more discretion over the medical procedure. Abortion may remain inaccessible for many women in these cases, however. For example, in Uruguay, a recent law that liberalized the country\u2019s policies still requires the pregnant person to meet with a panel of medical professionals who decide whether the abortion will be allowed\u2014and doctors have the right to refuse to perform it. This kind of reform appears to be as much about protecting doctors from criminal prosecution as it is about protecting the interests of pregnant people. Notably, access to abortion even expanded recently in Benin and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which are both heavily reliant on foreign funding. In 2019, roughly one-third of Benin\u2019s bilateral foreign aid came from the United States, but the government still reformed its abortion laws in October 2021 with an aim to improve sexual and reproductive health. Speaking in favor of the legislation, Benin\u2019s health minister noted that unsafe abortions had been responsible for up to 20 percent of maternal deaths in the country. When abortion is criminalized, patients who need medical treatment after an unsafe abortion may fear going to a hospital; if they do go, they often encounter staff with minimal training in abortion-related care. The United States\u2019 Mexico City Policy, which further reduces the availability of safe abortion-related services, can further exacerbate this problem. Benin\u2019s reforms, however, show that some aid-dependent countries are willing to risk the loss of U.S. funding under the next Republican administration in order to reap the health benefits of liberalizing abortion laws. In the  five decades  since  Roe v. Wade , most countries\u2019 abortion policies have depended more on health concerns, alliances with the Catholic Church, or the political power of medical professionals than on the domestic politics of the United States\u2014even when those politics translate to anti-abortion advocacy abroad. And in the years to come, the same factors that have driven liberalization thus far will continue to do so. Overturning  Roe  may embolden future U.S. administrations to push more aggressively for restrictions within and outside the United States, but the reversal may not be enough to turn back a slowly rising global tide of abortion liberalization.

came to office, the international order has often seemed defined by a resurgence of great-power conflict. China and the United States remain locked in a robust rivalry. In the wake of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Washington and its NATO allies have been drawn into a large-scale war in Europe that pits the liberal West against an autocratic Russia. In this volatile world, many analysts suggest, the most important kinds of power are once again military and economic: the continued ability of the United States to limit the threat of authoritarian rivals depends on the extent to which it can maintain the most advanced armed forces in the world and ensure that its economic might can outpace China\u2019s. Often overlooked in the commentary, however, are the ways in which military and economic power are dependent on social stability at home. Biden\u2019s populist predecessor, Donald Trump, exploited growing divisions over class, race, gender, and religion for political purposes. He also shunned multilateral alliances, pulled out of international agreements, and cultivated cozy relations with autocrats such as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin, all in the name of rejecting the values of liberal elites and the existing Western establishment in favor of a more nationalist, \u201cAmerica first\u201d vision. One result is that many U.S. allies today have much less confidence in the ability of Washington to uphold the liberal international order. Although they have welcomed renewed U.S. engagement in NATO and Europe, many European governments wonder how long the approach will last if another populist president is elected in 2024. The United States is not alone in facing deep social polarization. In many countries\u2014in both the West and other parts of the world\u2014political and social cleavages over class, race, gender, and religion have become increasingly pronounced. Rising income inequality has slowed growth and social mobility since the Great Recession of 2008, not only in countries such as Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States but also in Finland, Norway, and Sweden\u2014countries known for their more equitable wealth distributions. Anti-Asian hate crimes have risen sharply in the United States and globally since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent years, China and India have also experienced rising income inequality, and they now rank at the bottom of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index on women\u2019s health and survival. And religious freedom is diminishing in both of these countries, as well as in Hungary, Indonesia, and Russia. These tensions underscore a key point: as Western governments focus on international conflicts, strategic competition, and disruptions to the global economy, an even greater threat to world stability may come from internal social divisions that sap countries\u2019 unity and strength. These forces are all part of what might be called \u201cpower within\u201d\u2014the domestic social hierarchies that determine who gets to have power and why. And just as these hierarchies can affect national prosperity and social stability, they can also enhance or constrain a country\u2019s influence in the world. For any given country, the internal distribution of power may be as important to international relations as external geopolitical and ideological forces, since social hierarchies are often more deep-rooted, ubiquitous, insidious, and enduring. It is vital, then, to address these cleavages if the United States and its allies are to defend and revive the liberal international order. For decades, international relations experts have tended to downplay the role of domestic power relationships in shaping the world order. This has been true even with the growing recognition of soft power and other indirect forms of international influence: the concept of international power\u2014whether exercised through coercion, persuasion, seduction, or cooperation\u2014continues to be understood as fundamentally a matter of external relations between countries. Of course, political scientists have long recognized that foreign policy goals and outcomes are influenced by domestic politics. U.S. politicians often talk about getting their own house in order as a prerequisite for maintaining U.S. primacy in world affairs; Biden\u2019s version of this has been to call for \u201ca foreign policy for the middle class.\u201d But whether in the United States or elsewhere, such rhetoric has rarely led to a systematic and serious effort to understand how internal social hierarchies affect international power. The neglect has two main causes. First, scholars and policymakers have tended to frame the concept of power around national security. National security has traditionally been defined as protecting a country\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity against foreign military threats, an approach that tends to ignore nonmilitary and noneconomic sources of power. Second, the idea of world order is often conflated with the distribution of military and economic capabilities among countries, without taking account of the variations in social hierarchies within them. But as recent history has shown, analysts ignore these internal forces at their peril. There is now a significant body of data on the effects of social cleavages\u2014whether based on class, race, gender, or religion\u2014on political and economic power. Uneven access to new technology and education, for example, along with economic deregulation and cuts in welfare benefits, has led to a growing class divide between those at the top of social hierarchies and those lower down. According to the Pew Research Center, the income gap between the top ten percent and the bottom ten percent of earners in the United States increased by 39 percent between 1980 and 2018. The pattern is being repeated in middle-income and emerging-market countries, such as China and India, with an estimated two-thirds of the global population now experiencing growing income inequality. A Credit Suisse report found that at the end of 2019, only one percent of the world\u2019s adult population controlled over 43 percent of global personal wealth, whereas 54 percent of adults accounted for just two percent. Race has become another source of social and political division. Although racial disparities have never been far from the surface in the United States and other Western democracies, they have received much greater scrutiny in recent years. The Black Lives Matter movement has generated worldwide attention, driving activist campaigns to remove the statues of slaveholders and colonial rulers from public places, to seek reparations for the descendants of enslaved people, and to remove the names of avowed racists from venerable institutions. But these demands have also provoked a growing backlash from the nativistic right in both the United States and Europe, where racist violence has grown and racist ideas have increasingly come into the mainstream. In the United States, laws designed to protect the economic opportunities and voting rights of minorities have been rolled back. Although distinct from those of race, hierarchies of caste\u2014social groupings based on work or descent\u2014continue to shape political and economic power in many parts of the world. The Asia Dalit Rights Forum\u2014an organization devoted to defending the rights of members of low castes\u2014has estimated that some 260 million people worldwide, the majority of them in India and Nepal, suffer discrimination on the basis of caste identity. Under India\u2019s Hindu nationalist government, discrimination and abuse based on caste have grown in recent years, including a rise in violence against low-caste women. Gender disparities and religious persecution also continue to be widely prevalent. Despite progress in recent decades, the World Bank has estimated that some 2.4 billion working-age women worldwide still lack full economic rights. In 95 countries, women have no guarantee of equal pay, and 76 countries restrict women\u2019s property rights. In the case of religion, repressive practices have not only persisted but appear to be growing. The Pew Research Center has found that between 2007 and 2017, the number of governments imposing \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d levels of restrictions on religion increased from 40 to 52, and the number of countries experiencing high levels of \u201csocial hostilities involving religion\u201d jumped from 39 to 56. Notably, in a number of major states, leaders increasingly invoke their country\u2019s civilizational past in ways that encourage discrimination against minority groups and faiths. Consider India, where attacks on Muslim-owned businesses and Christian schools have dramatically increased, or Turkey, which has witnessed a steady erosion of secular values and a growing repression of religious minorities, or China, which has confined hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities in \u201creeducation camps.\u201d These social fault lines can have a direct impact on international relations. A country that can effectively manage its social hierarchies can often enhance its productivity, economic growth, and political stability, thereby increasing its influence in the world order. A country that cannot, however, may damage or undercut its international standing by eroding other countries\u2019 confidence in its stability or its commitment to international norms of social and human rights. Moreover, an unequal or socially restrictive internal distribution of power may also affect a country\u2019s long-term political and economic influence. It is particularly concerning, then, that domestic social disparities remain alarmingly high and in some cases appear to be increasing in many liberal democracies, including the United States. The distribution of power within countries matters to the international order above all because of its far-reaching economic impact. A 2014 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, for example, found that in the years leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis, rising income inequality lowered economic growth in Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States by between six and nine percentage points; for Mexico and New Zealand, the loss was an even larger ten percent. The same study also found that France, Ireland, and Spain\u2014countries in which income inequality was kept in check\u2014benefited from higher GDP growth. Many countries are also held back by racial disparities. Although the institution of slavery once propelled the United States and the West to global dominance\u2014by cheapening the cost of labor and boosting overall exports\u2014there is growing evidence that the long-term legacy of this unjust system has been lower economic growth, higher social instability, and persistent racial hierarchies. The consulting firm McKinsey & Company has estimated that between 2019 and 2028, the wealth gap between Black and white Americans will cost the U.S. economy $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion in lost consumption and investment. In India, caste plays a similar role. Although caste can increase economic activity and efficiency in the short run\u2014through networking and mutual support within castes\u2014the rigid social hierarchies it creates restrict capital and labor mobility. As researchers have pointed out, persistent caste structures have likely reduced India\u2019s growth by undermining efforts to alleviate poverty and achieve greater income equality and by slowing the country\u2019s transition to a full-fledged industrial economy. Similarly large is the impact of gender discrimination on national productivity. By restricting or limiting women\u2019s access to education, business, politics, and other areas of economic activity, gender discrimination also limits the labor supply. In developing countries, this is especially true in the agricultural sector, where women play a critical role. Constraints on women\u2019s participation in the workforce make it harder for low-income countries to move out of poverty. But gender barriers can affect advanced countries, as well. In 2016, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated that gender discrimination costs the global economy as much as $12 trillion per year, or about 16 percent of global GDP. Religious restrictions also make the business environment in many countries less attractive. In Egypt, for example, where tourists provide a major source of economic activity, the tourism sector has been negatively affected by religious conflicts, including violence between Christians and Muslims and between the Muslim Brotherhood and the regime of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Extensive religious restrictions in many Arab countries\u2014such as subjecting financial instruments to the arbitrary and inconsistent regulations of Islamic law boards\u2014have prompted young entrepreneurs to take their talents overseas. Sometimes, countries\u2019 repressive religious practices can also interfere with major international business deals. In 1999, Goldman Sachs had to restructure its initial public offering agreement with the China National Petroleum Corporation, which had investments in Sudan, after the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom recommended sanctions on Sudan for violations of religious freedom. (In the restructured deal, Goldman created a new company with CNPC that would operate only in China.) In all these ways, then, internal social divisions can have a direct impact on a country\u2019s economic performance and, hence, on one of the core forms of international power. But the effects of social cleavages can go well beyond economic growth. When social divisions are allowed to fester, they may threaten a country\u2019s underlying social and political stability. Recent conflicts in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Syria, and Yemen, among other places, have been driven by internal religious divisions. In 2021, the scholars Weiling Jiang and Igor Martek found that religious tensions ranked among the top four \u201csignificant political risk factors\u201d affecting foreign investment in the energy sector in 74 developing countries. In countries with acute income inequality, citizens may also be more prone to rise up against the government to achieve economic, social, and political parity. Governments that promote or sustain racial and religious discrimination may also encourage higher rates of violence or extremism. Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, on average, a low-caste Indian person was victimized by a crime every ten minutes. Gender-based violence has been particularly persistent in many countries. According to the World Health Organization, in 2021, 27 percent of women worldwide in the 15\u201349 age group who were in a relationship experienced some form of abuse, either physical or sexual violence or both, by an intimate partner. In the developing world, women suffer from specific forms of violence because of traditional social practices such as requiring dowries, honor killing, and genital mutilation. But violence against women is not restricted to poor countries. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime, for example, has included Australia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom among the countries that have the highest reported rates of sexual violence. The United States has a notably high rate of rape. Social tensions at home are likely to play out internationally. States experiencing violence or social instability may be limited in their ability to project soft power; they may also be prone to creating bilateral tensions and undermining free-trade negotiations and other forms of multilateral cooperation. Caste tensions are a perennial cause of political violence in India, which has undercut the country\u2019s global reputation. Although divisions over class, race, gender, and religion are increasing in many parts of the world, evidence suggests that when such tensions are reduced, countries can enhance their international power. For example, providing women with stronger legal rights and better access to health care, education, financial services, and technology is good not just for human rights or social justice but also for increasing productivity. According to Oxfam, rising numbers of women in the paid workforce in Latin America contributed to a 30 percent reduction in poverty between 2000 and 2010. In 2015, the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that the benefits to the world economy offered by the full inclusion of women in the paid workforce would equal $28 trillion by 2025. Countries can make similar gains by eliminating racial disparities. A study by the think tank PolicyLink and the University of Southern California found that removing the pay gap between racial groups would increase U.S. economic growth by 14 percent; the Washington Center for Equitable Growth has estimated that reducing racial, ethnic, and gender gaps could add $7.2 trillion a year to U.S. GDP. Such benefits would need to be weighed against the costs of government spending to equalize pay, but the rewards would still be substantial. Enhancing religious tolerance and freedom can also affect national economic competitiveness. Notably, none of the ten countries that the Pew Research Center has ranked as having \u201cvery high\u201d restrictions on religion\u2014a group that includes Algeria, China, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, the Maldives, Russia, Syria, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan\u2014is among the top 20 most competitive countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Index. Recognizing that power within can affect the external strength of countries offers important lessons for international relations. For the West, the growth of social cleavages should come as a warning. As a growing body of research shows, democracy does not inevitably lead to a reduction of hierarchies based on income, race, gender, or religion. Western democracies as a group have not performed particularly well in any of these areas. To the contrary, democratic institutions can provide cover for social divisions and allow them to be exploited for political gain, as has occurred in the United States and elsewhere in recent years. As these disparities become more pronounced, moreover, they also weaken the ability of the West to counter the spread of autocracy. For example, scholars have noted that rising income inequality has contributed to the eroding appeal of the liberal international order. These trends are not irreversible. In contrast to their nondemocratic counterparts, advanced democracies have the capacity to self-correct and challenge persistent social hierarchies. Because of their greater transparency, freedom of expression, and culture of open debate, democratic societies can expose these divisions, and their electorates can change governments that are viewed as unwilling or unable to address the root causes. Yet in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, democracies have been constrained by political polarization and the rise of right-wing populism, which have made it increasingly difficult to form a political consensus to tackle cleavages based on class, race, gender, and religion. At the same time, many advanced countries have established economic interests that may have a stake in reinforcing existing practices. Of course, internal power structures can also limit the influence of many non-Western countries. Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa are particularly striking examples of countries with large economies and significant socioeconomic disparities based on caste, gender, and religious identity. According to the World Bank, South Africa is the most unequal country in the world, with the wealthiest one percent of the population holding 80.6 percent of the country\u2019s financial assets. This is important not only because of the link between income inequality and low growth but also because of the incentive it creates for corruption and instability. In many countries, moreover, different types of social hierarchies often appear in tandem and are mutually reinforcing. Income inequality, for example, often correlates with racial, caste, gender, and religious discrimination. Racial prejudice is a trigger for religious intolerance and vice versa. Hence, policymakers will need to develop strategies that go beyond specific disparities to address the conditions that lead to all types of social hierarchies. Reducing social cleavages will not eliminate differences in power and status among countries. But those that better develop and harness their power within by ensuring fairer wage distribution and curbing discriminatory practices\u2014and therefore maximizing growth\u2014are likely to enjoy greater stability and influence in the long run. Such efforts will need to begin at home, including in the United States and in many of its European allies. But given the prevalence of these divisions in many countries, lasting progress is unlikely to be achieved through domestic politics alone. Stepped-up global cooperation will be needed, including collective efforts to strengthen international human rights agreements and other international rules aimed at preventing discrimination on the basis of race, caste, gender, and religious belief. Since all countries, rich and poor, suffer from these disparities, reform efforts can and should be framed as a common challenge of humankind. By creating a more level playing field among social groups, the United States and other members of the liberal international order can better mobilize their power within and promote their collective ability to enhance stability and peace in the world as a whole.

According to the Pew Research Center, the income gap between the top ten percent and the bottom ten percent of earners in the United States increased by 39 percent between 1980 and 2018. The pattern is being repeated in middle-income and emerging-market countries, such as China and India, with an estimated two-thirds of the global population now experiencing growing income inequality. A Credit Suisse report found that at the end of 2019, only one percent of the world\u2019s adult population controlled over 43 percent of global personal wealth, whereas 54 percent of adults accounted for just two percent.@@Race has become another source of social and political division. Although racial disparities have never been far from the surface in the United States and other Western democracies, they have received much greater scrutiny in recent years. The Black Lives Matter movement has generated worldwide attention, driving activist campaigns to remove the statues of slaveholders and colonial rulers from public places, to seek reparations for the descendants of enslaved people, and to remove the names of avowed racists from venerable institutions. But these demands have also provoked a growing backlash from the nativistic right in both the United States and Europe, where racist violence has grown and racist ideas have increasingly come into the mainstream. In the United States, laws designed to protect the economic opportunities and voting rights of minorities have been rolled back.@@Although distinct from those of race, hierarchies of caste\u2014social groupings based on work or descent\u2014continue to shape political and economic power in many parts of the world. The Asia Dalit Rights Forum\u2014an organization devoted to defending the rights of members of low castes\u2014has estimated that some 260 million people worldwide, the majority of them in India and Nepal, suffer discrimination on the basis of caste identity. Under India\u2019s Hindu nationalist government, discrimination and abuse based on caste have grown in recent years, including a rise in violence against low-caste women.@@Gender disparities and religious persecution also continue to be widely prevalent. Despite progress in recent decades, the World Bank has estimated that some 2.4 billion working-age women worldwide still lack full economic rights. In 95 countries, women have no guarantee of equal pay, and 76 countries restrict women\u2019s property rights. In the case of religion, repressive practices have not only persisted but appear to be growing. The Pew Research Center has found that between 2007 and 2017, the number of governments imposing \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cvery high\u201d levels of restrictions on religion increased from 40 to 52, and the number of countries experiencing high levels of \u201csocial hostilities involving religion\u201d jumped from 39 to 56. Notably, in a number of major states, leaders increasingly invoke their country\u2019s civilizational past in ways that encourage discrimination against minority groups and faiths. Consider India, where attacks on Muslim-owned businesses and Christian schools have dramatically increased, or Turkey, which has witnessed a steady erosion of secular values and a growing repression of religious minorities, or China, which has confined hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities in \u201creeducation camps.\u201d@@These social fault lines can have a direct impact on international relations. A country that can effectively manage its social hierarchies can often enhance its productivity, economic growth, and political stability, thereby increasing its influence in the world order. A country that cannot, however, may damage or undercut its international standing by eroding other countries\u2019 confidence in its stability or its commitment to international norms of social and human rights. Moreover, an unequal or socially restrictive internal distribution of power may also affect a country\u2019s long-term political and economic influence. It is particularly concerning, then, that domestic social disparities remain alarmingly high and in some cases appear to be increasing in many liberal democracies, including the United States.@@The distribution of power within countries matters to the international order above all because of its far-reaching economic impact. A 2014 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, for example, found that in the years leading up to the 2008 global financial crisis, rising income inequality lowered economic growth in Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States by between six and nine percentage points; for Mexico and New Zealand, the loss was an even larger ten percent. The same study also found that France, Ireland, and Spain\u2014countries in which income inequality was kept in check\u2014benefited from higher GDP growth.@@Many countries are also held back by racial disparities. Although the institution of slavery once propelled the United States and the West to global dominance\u2014by cheapening the cost of labor and boosting overall exports\u2014there is growing evidence that the long-term legacy of this unjust system has been lower economic growth, higher social instability, and persistent racial hierarchies. The consulting firm McKinsey & Company has estimated that between 2019 and 2028, the wealth gap between Black and white Americans will cost the U.S. economy $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion in lost consumption and investment. In India, caste plays a similar role. Although caste can increase economic activity and efficiency in the short run\u2014through networking and mutual support within castes\u2014the rigid social hierarchies it creates restrict capital and labor mobility. As researchers have pointed out, persistent caste structures have likely reduced India\u2019s growth by undermining efforts to alleviate poverty and achieve greater income equality and by slowing the country\u2019s transition to a full-fledged industrial economy.@@Similarly large is the impact of gender discrimination on national productivity. By restricting or limiting women\u2019s access to education, business, politics, and other areas of economic activity, gender discrimination also limits the labor supply. In developing countries, this is especially true in the agricultural sector, where women play a critical role. Constraints on women\u2019s participation in the workforce make it harder for low-income countries to move out of poverty. But gender barriers can affect advanced countries, as well. In 2016, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated that gender discrimination costs the global economy as much as $12 trillion per year, or about 16 percent of global GDP.@@Religious restrictions also make the business environment in many countries less attractive. In Egypt, for example, where tourists provide a major source of economic activity, the tourism sector has been negatively affected by religious conflicts, including violence between Christians and Muslims and between the Muslim Brotherhood and the regime of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Extensive religious restrictions in many Arab countries\u2014such as subjecting financial instruments to the arbitrary and inconsistent regulations of Islamic law boards\u2014have prompted young entrepreneurs to take their talents overseas. Sometimes, countries\u2019 repressive religious practices can also interfere with major international business deals. In 1999, Goldman Sachs had to restructure its initial public offering agreement with the China National Petroleum Corporation, which had investments in Sudan, after the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom recommended sanctions on Sudan for violations of religious freedom. (In the restructured deal, Goldman created a new company with CNPC that would operate only in China.) In all these ways, then, internal social divisions can have a direct impact on a country\u2019s economic performance and, hence, on one of the core forms of international power.@@But the effects of social cleavages can go well beyond economic growth. When social divisions are allowed to fester, they may threaten a country\u2019s underlying social and political stability. Recent conflicts in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Syria, and Yemen, among other places, have been driven by internal religious divisions. In 2021, the scholars Weiling Jiang and Igor Martek found that religious tensions ranked among the top four \u201csignificant political risk factors\u201d affecting foreign investment in the energy sector in 74 developing countries. In countries with acute income inequality, citizens may also be more prone to rise up against the government to achieve economic, social, and political parity. Governments that promote or sustain racial and religious discrimination may also encourage higher rates of violence or extremism. Notably, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, on average, a low-caste Indian person was victimized by a crime every ten minutes.@@Gender-based violence has been particularly persistent in many countries. According to the World Health Organization, in 2021, 27 percent of women worldwide in the 15\u201349 age group who were in a relationship experienced some form of abuse, either physical or sexual violence or both, by an intimate partner. In the developing world, women suffer from specific forms of violence because of traditional social practices such as requiring dowries, honor killing, and genital mutilation. But violence against women is not restricted to poor countries. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime, for example, has included Australia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom among the countries that have the highest reported rates of sexual violence. The United States has a notably high rate of rape.@@Social tensions at home are likely to play out internationally. States experiencing violence or social instability may be limited in their ability to project soft power; they may also be prone to creating bilateral tensions and undermining free-trade negotiations and other forms of multilateral cooperation. Caste tensions are a perennial cause of political violence in India, which has undercut the country\u2019s global reputation.@@Although divisions over class, race, gender, and religion are increasing in many parts of the world, evidence suggests that when such tensions are reduced, countries can enhance their international power. For example, providing women with stronger legal rights and better access to health care, education, financial services, and technology is good not just for human rights or social justice but also for increasing productivity. According to Oxfam, rising numbers of women in the paid workforce in Latin America contributed to a 30 percent reduction in poverty between 2000 and 2010. In 2015, the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that the benefits to the world economy offered by the full inclusion of women in the paid workforce would equal $28 trillion by 2025.@@Countries can make similar gains by eliminating racial disparities. A study by the think tank PolicyLink and the University of Southern California found that removing the pay gap between racial groups would increase U.S. economic growth by 14 percent; the Washington Center for Equitable Growth has estimated that reducing racial, ethnic, and gender gaps could add $7.2 trillion a year to U.S. GDP. Such benefits would need to be weighed against the costs of government spending to equalize pay, but the rewards would still be substantial.@@Enhancing religious tolerance and freedom can also affect national economic competitiveness. Notably, none of the ten countries that the Pew Research Center has ranked as having \u201cvery high\u201d restrictions on religion\u2014a group that includes Algeria, China, Egypt, Iran, Malaysia, the Maldives, Russia, Syria, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan\u2014is among the top 20 most competitive countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Index.@@Recognizing that power within can affect the external strength of countries offers important lessons for international relations. For the West, the growth of social cleavages should come as a warning. As a growing body of research shows, democracy does not inevitably lead to a reduction of hierarchies based on income, race, gender, or religion. Western democracies as a group have not performed particularly well in any of these areas. To the contrary, democratic institutions can provide cover for social divisions and allow them to be exploited for political gain, as has occurred in the United States and elsewhere in recent years. As these disparities become more pronounced, moreover, they also weaken the ability of the West to counter the spread of autocracy. For example, scholars have noted that rising income inequality has contributed to the eroding appeal of the liberal international order.@@These trends are not irreversible. In contrast to their nondemocratic counterparts, advanced democracies have the capacity to self-correct and challenge persistent social hierarchies. Because of their greater transparency, freedom of expression, and culture of open debate, democratic societies can expose these divisions, and their electorates can change governments that are viewed as unwilling or unable to address the root causes. Yet in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, democracies have been constrained by political polarization and the rise of right-wing populism, which have made it increasingly difficult to form a political consensus to tackle cleavages based on class, race, gender, and religion. At the same time, many advanced countries have established economic interests that may have a stake in reinforcing existing practices.@@Of course, internal power structures can also limit the influence of many non-Western countries. Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa are particularly striking examples of countries with large economies and significant socioeconomic disparities based on caste, gender, and religious identity. According to the World Bank, South Africa is the most unequal country in the world, with the wealthiest one percent of the population holding 80.6 percent of the country\u2019s financial assets. This is important not only because of the link between income inequality and low growth but also because of the incentive it creates for corruption and instability. In many countries, moreover, different types of social hierarchies often appear in tandem and are mutually reinforcing. Income inequality, for example, often correlates with racial, caste, gender, and religious discrimination. Racial prejudice is a trigger for religious intolerance and vice versa. Hence, policymakers will need to develop strategies that go beyond specific disparities to address the conditions that lead to all types of social hierarchies.@@Reducing social cleavages will not eliminate differences in power and status among countries. But those that better develop and harness their power within by ensuring fairer wage distribution and curbing discriminatory practices\u2014and therefore maximizing growth\u2014are likely to enjoy greater stability and influence in the long run. Such efforts will need to begin at home, including in the United States and in many of its European allies. But given the prevalence of these divisions in many countries, lasting progress is unlikely to be achieved through domestic politics alone. Stepped-up global cooperation will be needed, including collective efforts to strengthen international human rights agreements and other international rules aimed at preventing discrimination on the basis of race, caste, gender, and religious belief. Since all countries, rich and poor, suffer from these disparities, reform efforts can and should be framed as a common challenge of humankind. By creating a more level playing field among social groups, the United States and other members of the liberal international order can better mobilize their power within and promote their collective ability to enhance stability and peace in the world as a whole.", "download_timeout": 180.0, "download_slot": "www.foreignaffairs.com", "download_latency": 0.30180811882019043, "depth": 0, "status":

Closets are full of clothes stitched in other countries; electronics and cars are often assembled far from where consumers live. U.S. investment flows into Asian markets, and Indians decamp to the United States for graduate school. The numbers show the magnitude of international exchange. Trade among all countries hovers around $20 trillion, a nearly tenfold increase from 1980. International capital flows also grew exponentially during that period, from $500 billion a year to well over $4 trillion. And nearly five times as many people are traveling across borders compared with four decades ago. It is, however, misleading to claim that this flow of goods and services and people is always global in scale.  Globalization , as commonly understood, is mostly a myth; the reality is far closer to regionalization. When companies, supply chains, and individuals go abroad, they don\u2019t go just anywhere. More often than not, they stay fairly close to home. Consider  trade . If long distances didn\u2019t affect international sales, the typical journey for any given purchase would be some 5,300 miles (the average distance between two randomly selected countries). Instead, half of what is sold abroad travels less than 3,000 miles, not much farther than a flight across the United States, and certainly not far enough to cross oceans. A study by the logistics company DHL and scholars at the NYU Stern School of Business concluded, \u201cIf one pair of countries is half as distant as another otherwise similar pair of countries, this greater physical proximity alone would be expected to increase the merchandise trade between the closer pair by more than three times.\u201d Companies\u2019 forays abroad have been more regional than global, as well. A study of the Fortune Global 500, a list of the world\u2019s largest companies, shows that two of every three dollars of their sales come from their home regions. A study of 365 prominent multinationals found that just nine of them were truly global, meaning that Asia, Europe, and North America each accounted for at least 20 percent of their sales. Additionally, the oft-repeated term \u201cglobal supply chains\u201d is a misnomer. The making of things across borders tends to be even more regional than the buying and selling of finished products: the pieces and parts that come together in modern manufacturing are more likely to be shipped between neighboring countries than from farther away. International capital flows are also more regional than global. Cross-border buyers of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments don\u2019t invest as far away as one would expect given how global their options are, on average going no more than the distance between Tokyo and Singapore. Foreign direct investment tends to follow trade. Over half of all cross-border financing circulates solely within the European Union. And lending, borrowing, and foreign direct investment in Asia by Asian banks and companies is on the rise. People tend to orient their lives regionally, as well. Most people never leave their own countries. And for those who do travel abroad, well over half never leave their regions. The vast majority of travelers taking European vacations are European. The same goes for people in Asia and North America. Those who move permanently abroad also tend to stick close to their countries of origin; the majority don\u2019t leave their immediate region. And although students who venture internationally tend to go farther than other travelers, 40 percent don\u2019t leave the geographic area in which they were born. Over half the international flows of goods, money, information, and people occurs within three main regional hubs: Asia, Europe, and North America. The economic rise of China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam began with regional investments and inputs. Eastern Europe\u2019s fast-paced growth came from linking to western Europe. Between 1993 and 2007,  Mexico\u2019s  economy more than doubled in size, thanks in large part to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), reached in 1993 with Canada and the United States. The overlooked reality of regionalization has implications for U.S. policy. Although NAFTA was revised in 2020\u2014it is now the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)\u2014the North American hub is still not as integrated as that of its East Asian and European counterparts. In industries for which North American regional supply chains developed and solidified, such as vehicles and aerospace, local production maintained its edge. But in other sectors, including electronics and textiles, North America\u2019s more limited regionalization led whole industries to move wherever regional links provided a leg up. Ideally, the United States would be inking international trade deals to expand its market access and pursue its geopolitical aims, such as countering  China\u2019s rise . That does not appear politically possible at the moment, however. A more viable policy would be to fortify and tap the United States\u2019 regional network. That would allow Washington to access a broader swath of the global marketplace and stave off losing more of its competitive advantage to countries that are expanding their own regional footprints. The major reason networks skew regional is simple: geography matters. Even with massive container ships, moving things across oceans still costs time and money. A transatlantic voyage adds a week to delivery, and a trip across the Pacific Ocean adds a month before parts or goods show up in U.S. warehouses and factories. That means producers and stores need to maintain larger inventories of goods that come from far away. And it is not only cargo that can be delayed or lost when trade takes place over great distances. Even with virtually free calls, video, and file sharing, the inherent difficulty of communicating and coordinating across space and time can add to the costs of doing business. Language and cultural cues vary by country, and these differences often grow with distance. (This is one reason that a quarter of trade happens among countries that share a language.) Legal codes and administrative norms also tend to be more similar the closer countries are, eliminating the need for duplicate teams of lawyers, accountants, and human resources specialists. And the intangible but vital task of finding things in common and building trust and understanding for teamwork can get harder as the distance between people grows. Trade pacts as well tend to be regional. Although the 1990s saw the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the expansion of its membership and oversight powers, what has been as important, if not more so, over the last 30 years has been the proliferation of bilateral and multilateral free-trade agreements, which tend to involve countries in the same region. European countries turned first to each other for trade.  Brazil  joined with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. After reaching a bilateral trade deal with Israel, the United States turned to Canada and Mexico and later to ten other nations in the Western Hemisphere. Asian nations banded together through the free-trade area of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and later the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Global arrangements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the successor to a pact that was engineered by Washington but that the United States later abandoned, are so far more the exception than the rule. Companies see differences in their bottom lines depending on their geographic dispersion. Many have gone abroad to boost their earnings, benefiting from the cross-country advantages of differential skills and wage costs. Yet go too far, and costs begin to rise again. In 2010, an academic study of 123 U.S. multinationals found that returns on assets improved as companies expanded internationally within their region but declined when they ventured farther from home. The management consulting group McKinsey & Company dubs this \u201cthe globalization penalty,\u201d finding in a survey of 500 multinational corporations that earnings diminished as operations spread out. It seems the optimal distance for private-sector profits is a Goldilocks zone: not too close but not too far. The strength of the regional networks that a country belongs to are therefore particularly important. And in this regard, European countries are well situated. Although  Brexit  and mounting populist Euroskepticism may make the EU appear fragile, the European continent is, in fact, the most integrated region in the world. The deep ties that connect its countries are rooted in over a half century of diplomatic bargains that created a single market, a common passport, and a shared currency. Today, Europeans make things together and sell to one another, with nearly two-thirds of EU trade staying within the union. Similarly, internal European investment exceeds that from the rest of the world by 50 percent. Asia is not far behind in its integration. According to the Asian Development Bank, the proportion of the region\u2019s trade that takes place internally has risen from 45 percent in 1990 to nearly 60 percent today, surpassing North America and closing in on Europe. Decades of export-oriented  development  propelled by Asian business leaders and backed by bureaucrats tied country after country together through production supply chains. Asian countries make things together and increasingly buy from one another: nearly one-third of Asian finished goods are sold to consumers in the region. North America\u2019s countries have also deepened their economic ties to one another. In the wake of  NAFTA , trade between Canada, Mexico, and the United States rose fourfold, outpacing that between those countries and ones outside the region. Investment, too, became more regional, particularly for Mexico, where since NAFTA\u2019s signing in 1993, one of every two dollars flowing in has come from its neighbors. In particular, North America\u2019s agricultural and advanced-manufacturing supply chains expanded and strengthened over the course of the 1990s, leading regional commerce to jump by more than a quarter. This integration didn\u2019t last, however; after China\u2019s 2001 accession to the  WTO , regional exchanges dwindled, falling from around 47 percent of the continent\u2019s total trade in 2000 to a low of 39 percent in 2009, before recovering slightly to around 40 percent by 2018. Still, although North America\u2019s internal connections remain significantly less robust than those in Asia and Europe, they far outstrip those among the countries of Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia\u2014regions where less than a quarter of trade and investment occurs between neighbors. During the COVID-19  pandemic , border closures and rising transportation costs have prompted companies to consider bringing production closer to home. Governments have suddenly become keen to exercise more control over international supply chains for pharmaceutical and medical products. At the same time, ongoing technological innovation has made it easier for the private sector to expand production in different geographic neighborhoods. Automation, in particular, is making far-flung factories and supply chains less vital and less profitable than in the past. As sensors increasingly monitor assembly lines and equipment and robots and other forms of mechanization take over many manufacturing processes and tasks, wages make up a smaller part of operating costs. That development has diminished, at least in part, the once strong draw of locations with cheap labor. New ways of making things, such as 3-D or additive printing, are also changing manufacturing processes, making small-batch production runs more affordable and reducing the need for specialized factories. These advances lower the numbers of workers that companies need and change the skill sets they seek: in many sectors, skilled (and higher-paid) technicians have become far more important than line workers. That shift diminishes the advantages of economies of scale, enabling at least some companies to move production closer to consumers without sacrificing profits. The value of time is growing, too. As consumers expect faster delivery and near-immediate gratification, the longer lead times for goods produced by factories thousands of miles away can mean lost sales. The popularity of customized products also makes mass-producing facilities abroad less relevant than in the past. Moreover, demographic shifts are raising the low wages that once drew so many companies to developing countries. In China, the great migration that brought over 200 million workers from the hinterlands to manufacturing centers has largely ended. After  decades  of strict family planning, more workers are now exiting the labor market than entering it. This trend looks set to accelerate: the national workforce is expected to shrink by 100 million people over the next 20 years. Working-age populations are contracting throughout much of Asia, limiting labor pools and driving up wage rates across electronics and other supply chains. In Europe, working-age populations are in decline or appear to be headed that way. Millions of Hungarians, Romanians, and other eastern Europeans have headed to their western neighbors in search of better pay and opportunities, and an influx of migrants\u2014and, more recently, refugees\u2014is only partly replenishing workforces. Another factor curbing globalization is  climate change . Extreme weather will increasingly upend logistics as ports flood, rails buckle, and airplanes are more frequently grounded by storms. Longer supply chains increase these vulnerabilities and potential costs. Meanwhile, policies designed to slow the planet\u2019s warming by cutting emissions are raising global transportation prices, incentivizing companies to manufacture goods closer to consumer markets. It\u2019s not just technological and demographic shifts and climate change that will curb globalization and favor more regionalization; political change is playing a role, as well. After decades of opening up to the world economy, many countries are pulling back. The Global Trade Alert, a nonprofit that tracks and collates trade policies from official sources around the world, has calculated that since the 2008 global financial crisis, new protectionist measures have outpaced liberalizing ones three to one. Meanwhile, the WTO has been sidelined. It is no longer the forum to negotiate new trade rules. Its efforts to reshape global trade ended in 2015, when the so-called Doha Round of talks sputtered to a close. More niche efforts, such as attempts to reduce fishing subsidies in mostly rich nations, are struggling. Since 2018, the WTO has been unable to punish countries that break the rules, as the United States, under both the Trump and the Biden administrations, has refused to approve new judges to its Appellate Body. Instead, regional accords have stepped in to govern international trade. The USMCA regulates North America\u2019s trade ties and arbitrates disputes. In Asia, the RCEP now governs commercial exchanges among 15 countries, removing most tariffs and combining rules of origin requirements to favor regional supply chains. The African Continental Free Trade Area agreement aspires to do something similar, replacing a tangle of bilateral rules and regulations with a single, almost continent-wide commercial system. Regional accords now set the rules for more than half the world\u2019s trade. Geopolitical tensions threaten to fragment international commerce even further. Economic competition has become a pillar of great-power rivalry. With industrial policy back in vogue, many countries, including the United States, are throwing up protectionist barriers. The U.S. government has identified semiconductors, large-capacity batteries, pharmaceuticals, and dozens of critical minerals as vital to national security and is now implementing policies and spending tens of billions of dollars to expand stockpiles, beef up manufacturing capacity at home and in friendly nations, and redraw global supply chains in these designated sectors. Countries everywhere are drawing up their own lists, some of them adding information and data flows, fragmenting cross-border flows of services. As governments work to reshape the business environment across more industries, they are also implicitly or explicitly asking other countries to choose sides through export controls and other mechanisms. This will further limit international ties. The push to reshore critical products and services is underway almost everywhere. But what most countries will find is that outside of a few highly sensitive or vital products, companies can\u2019t or won\u2019t bring production back home. Those that try to do so are more likely to go bust as costs rise and innovation falls. The most probable scenario is that multinationals will turn away from globalized supply chains in favor of shorter, more duplicative regional ones. Regionalization, not  globalization , will set the corporate agenda in the coming decades. Many of these technological, demographic, and policy shifts favor the United States. The declining importance of cheap wages and the rising role of skilled labor should advantage better-paid U.S. workers. A trove of intellectual property and intangible assets, including several of the new technologies transforming work and workplaces, will allow many U.S.-based companies to reap outsize benefits. Abundant financing means more discoveries, more patents, and more products. The United States also boasts clear laws and regulatory regimes\u2014which is why so many investors prefer stocks and bonds issued under New York law\u2014and a generally receptive and entrepreneurial business environment. For all these reasons, the U.S. economy should fare well in this next round of globalization. Still, Washington\u2019s advantages aren\u2019t immutable. Other countries are also investing in  education , research, and development and advancing their own technologies and national corporate champions. Moreover, the next billion new buyers of cars, clothes, and computers will be in Asia, where middle classes are growing faster than in any other region. To tap into this growth, U.S. multinationals and exporters will need to adapt. To effectively compete, the United States should pursue reforms at home to take better care of its people and workers and to prepare them for a more fluid and volatile economic future. This will require expanding safety nets, ensuring labor rights, and improving educational opportunities that upgrade Americans\u2019 skills. Domestic infrastructure also needs an upgrade to lower logistical costs that weigh down American-made goods. The $1.2 trillion set aside in the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to pay for improvements to highways, bridges, electric grids, and broadband is a good start. More public spending for basic science and research and development should follow to usher in cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs and technologies. In addition to getting its own house in order, the United States needs a more strategic approach to  trade . One of the country\u2019s challenges is the eroding price competitiveness of its exports in an increasing number of international markets. The countries to which the United States enjoys preferred access account for less than 10 percent of the world\u2019s GDP, and few of them are among the fastest-growing markets. As other countries have formed and joined trade accords, the cost of U.S. exports has risen in relative terms. Because of the RCEP, cars assembled in Japan and South Korea no longer face the double-digit tariffs that U.S.-manufactured alternatives still confront in the region, and Chinese steel, chemicals, and machines all face lower levies than options made in the United States. In an ideal world, the United States would pursue a robust and comprehensive trade agenda. Joining the CPTPP; restarting negotiations over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which would have linked the U.S. and EU markets; and revitalizing the WTO would open up more markets to U.S. goods and services and reinforce more transparent, fair, and environmentally friendly ways of doing business. The United States would also do well to regain its leadership in international standard-setting bodies, restoring its traditional role as a rule-maker and not just rule-taker. A production line in production line in Shenzhen, China, September 2019   Jason Lee / Reuters   But until the politics of trade change in the United States, none of that is likely to occur. In the meantime, Washington can benefit by turning to its neighbors. Canada and Mexico have preferred access to many global markets where the United States pays full fare. Their respective portfolios of free-trade agreements each cover some 1.5 billion consumers, representing nearly 60 percent of global GDP. Feeding into Canadian or Mexican manufacturing supply chains can give U.S. producers and parts makers preferential access to the world\u2019s consumers, which they currently lack on their own. For instance, Mexican-made cars sold in Europe dodge the ten percent tariff U.S.-made models face, lowering the sticker price by some $3,000 on a Ford Focus and by over $4,000 on an Audi Q5, a savings that makes it hard for U.S. carmakers to compete. The opposite is true for U.S.-based parts makers: Mexican plants can source up to 40 percent of their Europe-bound models from suppliers in countries that are not part of the bargain. That means imported Mexican-made cars sold in France or Germany also keep U.S. factories humming. In today\u2019s more regionally focused world, exports are more competitive when countries make them together. Much of  Germany\u2019s  touted international commercial success has resulted from its regional manufacturing ties. By seeding plants and operations throughout eastern Europe, Germany\u2019s private companies\u2014the famed Mittelstand\u2014have bolstered the country\u2019s manufacturing base and created jobs at home as their products have thrived on global markets. China\u2019s spectacular rise and export dynamism similarly has depended largely on its incorporation into regional supply chains. If the United States wants to help its companies replicate these successes, it also needs a regional approach. Regionalization brings competitive advantages that a single country, even one as large and wealthy as the United States, cannot match on its own. To make products as good, affordable, and fast as the competition, U.S. companies need to be able to source parts from many places and complete some tasks and processes in other countries. A regional commercial strategy will also help more work stay on the continent\u2014and thus in the United States. When part of production is located in Canada or Mexico, U.S. suppliers are more likely to keep or gain contracts and remain in business than when production moves overseas. And when orders rise, so do jobs all along the supply chain. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that, on average, nearly 40 percent of the value of U.S. imports from Mexico is created in the United States. For Canada, that figure is just over 25 percent. Conversely, U.S. input into imports from the rest of the world averages just 4.4 percent, reflecting how few U.S.-based suppliers are part of the global production process. To enhance North America\u2019s regionalization, the continent needs to improve its linking infrastructure. This means adding land crossings, upgrading thoroughfares that lead to and away from the border, expanding rail lines and depots, and investing in people and technology to staff and to support ports of entry. With faster connections and lower logistical costs, manufacturers in  North America  can make products that are more globally competitive. As parts and components move between the three countries, workers must be able to follow. More and easier legal work-based migration paths are needed to make the region as a whole more productive, and they will require transferable credentials, licenses, and diplomas; business visas; and longer-term migration avenues. Greater coordination in education and training can help address gaps in skill and improve work environments to ensure that North America\u2019s population growth, already a bright spot for the region,  continues . Educational exchanges, language learning, and cross-border apprenticeships and skill development programs can all help build a continental workforce better able to entice new businesses and investment. Stiffening migration barriers will just lead more firms to go elsewhere. And as the U.S. government rolls out industrial policies to increase the resilience of and access to a host of critical supply chains, its neighbors can help. Geographic diversification can offset the risks that natural disasters and accidents pose to stockpiles and production capacity. Regional manufacturing can lower the public financial burden of subsidies, as goods are more likely to attain a higher quality at lower cost when drawing on a cross-border network of suppliers. North America\u2019s regional trade has recovered, albeit slightly, from a 2009 nadir of just 39 cents of every dollar thanks to expanding textile, machinery, and produce supply chains. But no North American leader is prioritizing a continental commercial future.  Mexico  is turning inward, with energy and natural resource nationalism threatening its manufacturing base. Canada is looking to diversify its international commercial ties by reaping the benefit of trade deals with the United Kingdom and the European Union and in Asia as a member of the CPTPP. And the Biden administration is guided by another repeated but unsubstantiated refrain, that NAFTA and other trade agreements hurt, rather than help, U.S. workers. That is misguided: most of the studies trashing NAFTA don\u2019t calculate the better-paid export-oriented jobs gained as a result of more favorable terms in the United States\u2019 two biggest export markets; nor do they consider how lower North American production costs kept industries, such as auto manufacturing, alive and even allowed them to thrive in the face of global price competition from vehicles manufactured in other, rival regional hubs. Through integration, a more competitive North American economy is  possible . Three decades of freer trade, the existence of sophisticated supply chains in specific sectors, and widespread cross-border ties between communities and workers due to the movement of tens of millions of people could be energized and expanded. But deeper, more sustainable regionalization will also require a change in mindset. It will require recognizing that the United States\u2019 middle and working class would prosper more from engagement in the global economy than they would from a retreat to the domestic market.

Closets are full of clothes stitched in other countries; electronics and cars are often assembled far from where consumers live. U.S. investment flows into Asian markets, and Indians decamp to the United States for graduate school. The numbers show the magnitude of international exchange. Trade among all countries hovers around $20 trillion, a nearly tenfold increase from 1980. International capital flows also grew exponentially during that period, from $500 billion a year to well over $4 trillion. And nearly five times as many people are traveling across borders compared with four decades ago.@@It is, however, misleading to claim that this flow of goods and services and people is always global in scale. @@, as commonly understood, is mostly a myth; the reality is far closer to regionalization. When companies, supply chains, and individuals go abroad, they don\u2019t go just anywhere. More often than not, they stay fairly close to home.@@Consider @@. If long distances didn\u2019t affect international sales, the typical journey for any given purchase would be some 5,300 miles (the average distance between two randomly selected countries). Instead, half of what is sold abroad travels less than 3,000 miles, not much farther than a flight across the United States, and certainly not far enough to cross oceans. A study by the logistics company DHL and scholars at the NYU Stern School of Business concluded, \u201cIf one pair of countries is half as distant as another otherwise similar pair of countries, this greater physical proximity alone would be expected to increase the merchandise trade between the closer pair by more than three times.\u201d@@Companies\u2019 forays abroad have been more regional than global, as well. A study of the Fortune Global 500, a list of the world\u2019s largest companies, shows that two of every three dollars of their sales come from their home regions. A study of 365 prominent multinationals found that just nine of them were truly global, meaning that Asia, Europe, and North America each accounted for at least 20 percent of their sales.@@Additionally, the oft-repeated term \u201cglobal supply chains\u201d is a misnomer. The making of things across borders tends to be even more regional than the buying and selling of finished products: the pieces and parts that come together in modern manufacturing are more likely to be shipped between neighboring countries than from farther away.@@International capital flows are also more regional than global. Cross-border buyers of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments don\u2019t invest as far away as one would expect given how global their options are, on average going no more than the distance between Tokyo and Singapore. Foreign direct investment tends to follow trade. Over half of all cross-border financing circulates solely within the European Union. And lending, borrowing, and foreign direct investment in Asia by Asian banks and companies is on the rise.@@People tend to orient their lives regionally, as well. Most people never leave their own countries. And for those who do travel abroad, well over half never leave their regions. The vast majority of travelers taking European vacations are European. The same goes for people in Asia and North America. Those who move permanently abroad also tend to stick close to their countries of origin; the majority don\u2019t leave their immediate region. And although students who venture internationally tend to go farther than other travelers, 40 percent don\u2019t leave the geographic area in which they were born.@@Over half the international flows of goods, money, information, and people occurs within three main regional hubs: Asia, Europe, and North America. The economic rise of China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam began with regional investments and inputs. Eastern Europe\u2019s fast-paced growth came from linking to western Europe. Between 1993 and 2007, @@ economy more than doubled in size, thanks in large part to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), reached in 1993 with Canada and the United States.@@The overlooked reality of regionalization has implications for U.S. policy. Although NAFTA was revised in 2020\u2014it is now the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)\u2014the North American hub is still not as integrated as that of its East Asian and European counterparts. In industries for which North American regional supply chains developed and solidified, such as vehicles and aerospace, local production maintained its edge. But in other sectors, including electronics and textiles, North America\u2019s more limited regionalization led whole industries to move wherever regional links provided a leg up.@@Ideally, the United States would be inking international trade deals to expand its market access and pursue its geopolitical aims, such as countering @@. That does not appear politically possible at the moment, however. A more viable policy would be to fortify and tap the United States\u2019 regional network. That would allow Washington to access a broader swath of the global marketplace and stave off losing more of its competitive advantage to countries that are expanding their own regional footprints.@@The major reason networks skew regional is simple: geography matters. Even with massive container ships, moving things across oceans still costs time and money. A transatlantic voyage adds a week to delivery, and a trip across the Pacific Ocean adds a month before parts or goods show up in U.S. warehouses and factories. That means producers and stores need to maintain larger inventories of goods that come from far away.@@And it is not only cargo that can be delayed or lost when trade takes place over great distances. Even with virtually free calls, video, and file sharing, the inherent difficulty of communicating and coordinating across space and time can add to the costs of doing business. Language and cultural cues vary by country, and these differences often grow with distance. (This is one reason that a quarter of trade happens among countries that share a language.) Legal codes and administrative norms also tend to be more similar the closer countries are, eliminating the need for duplicate teams of lawyers, accountants, and human resources specialists. And the intangible but vital task of finding things in common and building trust and understanding for teamwork can get harder as the distance between people grows.@@Trade pacts as well tend to be regional. Although the 1990s saw the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the expansion of its membership and oversight powers, what has been as important, if not more so, over the last 30 years has been the proliferation of bilateral and multilateral free-trade agreements, which tend to involve countries in the same region. European countries turned first to each other for trade. @@ joined with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. After reaching a bilateral trade deal with Israel, the United States turned to Canada and Mexico and later to ten other nations in the Western Hemisphere. Asian nations banded together through the free-trade area of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and later the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Global arrangements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the successor to a pact that was engineered by Washington but that the United States later abandoned, are so far more the exception than the rule.@@Companies see differences in their bottom lines depending on their geographic dispersion. Many have gone abroad to boost their earnings, benefiting from the cross-country advantages of differential skills and wage costs. Yet go too far, and costs begin to rise again. In 2010, an academic study of 123 U.S. multinationals found that returns on assets improved as companies expanded internationally within their region but declined when they ventured farther from home. The management consulting group McKinsey & Company dubs this \u201cthe globalization penalty,\u201d finding in a survey of 500 multinational corporations that earnings diminished as operations spread out. It seems the optimal distance for private-sector profits is a Goldilocks zone: not too close but not too far.@@The strength of the regional networks that a country belongs to are therefore particularly important. And in this regard, European countries are well situated. Although @@ and mounting populist Euroskepticism may make the EU appear fragile, the European continent is, in fact, the most integrated region in the world. The deep ties that connect its countries are rooted in over a half century of diplomatic bargains that created a single market, a common passport, and a shared currency. Today, Europeans make things together and sell to one another, with nearly two-thirds of EU trade staying within the union. Similarly, internal European investment exceeds that from the rest of the world by 50 percent.@@Asia is not far behind in its integration. According to the Asian Development Bank, the proportion of the region\u2019s trade that takes place internally has risen from 45 percent in 1990 to nearly 60 percent today, surpassing North America and closing in on Europe. Decades of export-oriented @@ propelled by Asian business leaders and backed by bureaucrats tied country after country together through production supply chains. Asian countries make things together and increasingly buy from one another: nearly one-third of Asian finished goods are sold to consumers in the region.@@North America\u2019s countries have also deepened their economic ties to one another. In the wake of @@, trade between Canada, Mexico, and the United States rose fourfold, outpacing that between those countries and ones outside the region. Investment, too, became more regional, particularly for Mexico, where since NAFTA\u2019s signing in 1993, one of every two dollars flowing in has come from its neighbors. In particular, North America\u2019s agricultural and advanced-manufacturing supply chains expanded and strengthened over the course of the 1990s, leading regional commerce to jump by more than a quarter.@@This integration didn\u2019t last, however; after China\u2019s 2001 accession to the @@, regional exchanges dwindled, falling from around 47 percent of the continent\u2019s total trade in 2000 to a low of 39 percent in 2009, before recovering slightly to around 40 percent by 2018. Still, although North America\u2019s internal connections remain significantly less robust than those in Asia and Europe, they far outstrip those among the countries of Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia\u2014regions where less than a quarter of trade and investment occurs between neighbors.@@During the COVID-19 @@, border closures and rising transportation costs have prompted companies to consider bringing production closer to home. Governments have suddenly become keen to exercise more control over international supply chains for pharmaceutical and medical products. At the same time, ongoing technological innovation has made it easier for the private sector to expand production in different geographic neighborhoods. Automation, in particular, is making far-flung factories and supply chains less vital and less profitable than in the past. As sensors increasingly monitor assembly lines and equipment and robots and other forms of mechanization take over many manufacturing processes and tasks, wages make up a smaller part of operating costs. That development has diminished, at least in part, the once strong draw of locations with cheap labor.@@New ways of making things, such as 3-D or additive printing, are also changing manufacturing processes, making small-batch production runs more affordable and reducing the need for specialized factories. These advances lower the numbers of workers that companies need and change the skill sets they seek: in many sectors, skilled (and higher-paid) technicians have become far more important than line workers. That shift diminishes the advantages of economies of scale, enabling at least some companies to move production closer to consumers without sacrificing profits.@@The value of time is growing, too. As consumers expect faster delivery and near-immediate gratification, the longer lead times for goods produced by factories thousands of miles away can mean lost sales. The popularity of customized products also makes mass-producing facilities abroad less relevant than in the past.@@Moreover, demographic shifts are raising the low wages that once drew so many companies to developing countries. In China, the great migration that brought over 200 million workers from the hinterlands to manufacturing centers has largely ended. After @@ of strict family planning, more workers are now exiting the labor market than entering it. This trend looks set to accelerate: the national workforce is expected to shrink by 100 million people over the next 20 years. Working-age populations are contracting throughout much of Asia, limiting labor pools and driving up wage rates across electronics and other supply chains. In Europe, working-age populations are in decline or appear to be headed that way. Millions of Hungarians, Romanians, and other eastern Europeans have headed to their western neighbors in search of better pay and opportunities, and an influx of migrants\u2014and, more recently, refugees\u2014is only partly replenishing workforces.@@Another factor curbing globalization is @@. Extreme weather will increasingly upend logistics as ports flood, rails buckle, and airplanes are more frequently grounded by storms. Longer supply chains increase these vulnerabilities and potential costs. Meanwhile, policies designed to slow the planet\u2019s warming by cutting emissions are raising global transportation prices, incentivizing companies to manufacture goods closer to consumer markets.@@It\u2019s not just technological and demographic shifts and climate change that will curb globalization and favor more regionalization; political change is playing a role, as well. After decades of opening up to the world economy, many countries are pulling back. The Global Trade Alert, a nonprofit that tracks and collates trade policies from official sources around the world, has calculated that since the 2008 global financial crisis, new protectionist measures have outpaced liberalizing ones three to one.@@Meanwhile, the WTO has been sidelined. It is no longer the forum to negotiate new trade rules. Its efforts to reshape global trade ended in 2015, when the so-called Doha Round of talks sputtered to a close. More niche efforts, such as attempts to reduce fishing subsidies in mostly rich nations, are struggling. Since 2018, the WTO has been unable to punish countries that break the rules, as the United States, under both the Trump and the Biden administrations, has refused to approve new judges to its Appellate Body.@@Instead, regional accords have stepped in to govern international trade. The USMCA regulates North America\u2019s trade ties and arbitrates disputes. In Asia, the RCEP now governs commercial exchanges among 15 countries, removing most tariffs and combining rules of origin requirements to favor regional supply chains. The African Continental Free Trade Area agreement aspires to do something similar, replacing a tangle of bilateral rules and regulations with a single, almost continent-wide commercial system. Regional accords now set the rules for more than half the world\u2019s trade.@@Geopolitical tensions threaten to fragment international commerce even further. Economic competition has become a pillar of great-power rivalry. With industrial policy back in vogue, many countries, including the United States, are throwing up protectionist barriers. The U.S. government has identified semiconductors, large-capacity batteries, pharmaceuticals, and dozens of critical minerals as vital to national security and is now implementing policies and spending tens of billions of dollars to expand stockpiles, beef up manufacturing capacity at home and in friendly nations, and redraw global supply chains in these designated sectors. Countries everywhere are drawing up their own lists, some of them adding information and data flows, fragmenting cross-border flows of services. As governments work to reshape the business environment across more industries, they are also implicitly or explicitly asking other countries to choose sides through export controls and other mechanisms. This will further limit international ties.@@The push to reshore critical products and services is underway almost everywhere. But what most countries will find is that outside of a few highly sensitive or vital products, companies can\u2019t or won\u2019t bring production back home. Those that try to do so are more likely to go bust as costs rise and innovation falls. The most probable scenario is that multinationals will turn away from globalized supply chains in favor of shorter, more duplicative regional ones. Regionalization, not @@, will set the corporate agenda in the coming decades.@@Many of these technological, demographic, and policy shifts favor the United States. The declining importance of cheap wages and the rising role of skilled labor should advantage better-paid U.S. workers. A trove of intellectual property and intangible assets, including several of the new technologies transforming work and workplaces, will allow many U.S.-based companies to reap outsize benefits. Abundant financing means more discoveries, more patents, and more products. The United States also boasts clear laws and regulatory regimes\u2014which is why so many investors prefer stocks and bonds issued under New York law\u2014and a generally receptive and entrepreneurial business environment. For all these reasons, the U.S. economy should fare well in this next round of globalization.@@Still, Washington\u2019s advantages aren\u2019t immutable. Other countries are also investing in @@, research, and development and advancing their own technologies and national corporate champions. Moreover, the next billion new buyers of cars, clothes, and computers will be in Asia, where middle classes are growing faster than in any other region.

What up to this point may have seemed like an abstract and inchoate challenge has suddenly become real, urgent, and perilous. In response, many U.S. officials and analysts have called for the United States to enhance its military capabilities, harden its defenses, and invest in key technologies. Washington must prepare to have its will tested again and again, they say, whether by proxy wars or by other challenges to the United States\u2019 network of alliances and security partnerships. Success in great-power competition, in this view, depends on accumulating victories in a series of individual contests for supremacy. History offers a different lesson. Nations do not prevail in enduring competitions chiefly by acquiring superior technological or military capabilities or even by imposing their will in every crisis or war. Great powers can make many mistakes\u2014lose wars, lose allies, even lose their military edge\u2014and still triumph in long-term contests. In the struggle for advantage among world powers, it is not military or economic might that makes the crucial difference but the fundamental qualities of a society: the characteristics of a nation that generate economic productivity, technological innovation, social cohesion, and national will. This is not a new insight, of course. American politicians, scholars, and pundits have for decades paid lip service to the idea that a dynamic and resilient home front is the foundation for success abroad. But behind such vague bromides are specific national qualities that social scientists can identify and measure. Over the course of 15 months, I led a RAND Corporation study for the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s Office of Net Assessment, supported by analysis from outside historians, that did exactly that. Drawing on historical case studies and research on economic development, technological advancement, and much else, we isolated a number of national characteristics that throughout history have underpinned national competitive success\u2014including a strong national ambition, a culture of learning and adaptation, and significant diversity and pluralism. These domestic strengths are the building blocks of international power. But to enable a country to succeed, they must reinforce and support one another. And they must not fall out of balance. Too much national ambition, for instance, can lead to overreach, imperiling the country that overcommits itself. But countries with too little ambition, diversity, or willingness to learn and adapt risk starting a negative cycle that can spiral into national decline. Today, the United States finds itself deficient in many of the qualities that powered its rise over the second half of the twentieth century. If it is to regain its competitive advantage\u2014and prevail in its current contests with  China  and  Russia \u2014it will have to do more than just outspend its rivals on defense or advanced military technologies. It will have to nurture the qualities that make great powers dynamic, innovative, and adaptive. On the eve of the Peloponnesian War in 432 BC, a delegation from Corinth traveled to Sparta in a last-ditch effort to prevent what would become a generational conflict. In his history of the war, Thucydides recounts how the Corinthians accused the Spartans, their allies, of turning a blind eye to the alarming growth of Athenian power. \u201cThe Athenians are addicted to innovation, and their designs are characterized by swiftness alike in conception and execution; you have a genius for keeping what you have got, accompanied by a total want of invention, and when forced to act, you never go far enough,\u201d the Corinthians complained. They continued: \u201cTo describe their character in a word, one might truly say that they were born into the world to take no rest themselves and to give none to others.\u201d Put differently, Athens posed a danger not primarily because of the size of its navy, the richness of its soil, or the number of its people. It stood to supplant Sparta as the dominant power for a broader and more encompassing reason: the superior qualities of its social and political system. A remarkably similar story unfolded some 2,000 years later. The United States ultimately prevailed over the Soviet Union in the Cold War because it was more energetic, innovative, productive, and legitimate. Indeed, some commentators made the comparison directly, casting Washington as the Athens of that drama to Moscow\u2019s lethargic, conservative Sparta. The lesson of both historical rivalries applies to nearly all contests between world powers. Almost always, nations rise and fall because of a complex and interlinked set of social characteristics that produce national dynamism and competitive advantage. Yet identifying these characteristics poses an analytic challenge. Most are abstract and ill defined. Many are also difficult, perhaps even impossible, to measure reliably, especially in historical cases where accurate data simply do not exist. In complex geopolitical interactions, tracing definitive causal relationships can be difficult or impossible. Partly as a result, many efforts to identify the factors underpinning dynamism and competitiveness have produced essentialist theories about national will or decadence or have posited the superiority of certain cultures. Any attempt to overcome this challenge must first define the yardstick for national success or failure. Measures of economic growth or indicators of technological innovation might seem like obvious answers. But these are intervening factors: economic growth is a source of national power to be sure, but it is also a product of more fundamental factors that generate economic development. The same is true of innovation, military sophistication, productivity, and many other common output measures of national power. An added complication is that some countries that score high on characteristics associated with national dynamism and competitiveness do not rise to the top of the global hierarchy. Some, such as the Netherlands and Singapore, are too small. Others, such as Sweden and South Korea, have lost or never had a drive for global leadership. Still, they generate economic growth, technological sophistication, high living standards, national cohesion, and many other outcomes associated with success. A related issue is that factors other than societal characteristics can make a critical difference in specific conflicts: Athens had more geopolitical power and long-term cultural influence than Sparta, but thanks in part to a devastating pandemic and strategic blunders such as its invasion of Sicily, it did lose the Peloponnesian War. What all this means is that any effort to identify advantageous societal qualities must consider absolute measures of national strength, such as longevity and ability to provide security and prosperity, and relative ones, such as success or failure in bilateral rivalries or standing on the world stage. Our RAND Corporation study looked at both. We examined the literature on the rise and fall of nations and on the sources of economic and technological progress, conducted a dozen major historical case studies, and supplemented that historical scholarship with more recent research on a variety of issues such as inequality, diversity, and national identity. We found that nations that demonstrate both absolute and relative forms of competitive success tend to reflect, either in specific periods of ascendancy or longer-term positions atop the global hierarchy, seven leading characteristics: a driving national ambition, shared opportunity for citizens, a common and coherent national identity, an active state, effective social institutions, an emphasis on learning and adaptation, and significant diversity and pluralism. The causal links between these characteristics and national competitive success, while generally consistent, vary across time and from country to country. And these are not the only variables associated with national success: other factors, such as natural disasters, pandemics, and geography, obviously matter. But a broad survey of the evidence suggests that these seven characteristics play an outsize role in determining the competitive fate of nations. The first essential characteristic\u2014arguably the foundation for all forms of relative national strength\u2014is some version of driving national ambition. Externally, this trait produces a sense of national mission and greatness and a desire to influence world politics. Internally, it generates a national drive to learn, achieve, and succeed in everything from scientific research to business and industry to the arts. Driving national ambition demands the commitment of a whole people to gain knowledge about and leverage over their world: to explore and control, to understand and direct. This impulse can easily go wrong. Excessive national ambition is a common route to failure, whether through destructive wars of choice or imperial conquests that overextend a nation\u2019s resources and provoke destructive reactions. But without such ambition, countries seldom build potent domestic economic or technological engines or prevail in relative contests for power. Much of the evidence for the importance of national ambition comes from the historical record and the nearly one-to-one relationship between competitive success and some version of this characteristic. Rome, for example, had a driving ambition: its rise to greatness during the middle and late Republic and early Empire and its supremacy over the major powers of its day were propelled by a powerful societal custom that valorized control, mastery, and conquest. Similar kinds of ambition, including the domestic urge for accomplishment and discovery, can be found in all highly competitive nations\u2014the United Kingdom, the United States, Meiji Japan, the city-states of the Italian Renaissance, and others. Deteriorating societies tend to reflect the withering of this adventurous spirit and everything that goes with it, including a thirst for improvement, an appetite for new knowledge, and a willingness to take risks. In addition to having a driving national ambition, highly competitive societies tend to share opportunities widely among their citizens. They offer many routes to success and exclude relatively few segments of their population from productive roles\u2014at least as compared with their main rivals. In so doing, they leverage a high proportion of their available talent and provide real prospects to a broad cross section of their population. Over time, societies that exhibit this trait have become more inclusive in various ways, including in granting full rights and opportunities to all social groups and in providing clear pathways to entrepreneurial and creative advancement. Rome, Meiji Japan, and even industrial-era Great Britain gained powerful advantage from versions of shared opportunity that would look incredibly restrictive to modern eyes. But by the standards of their time, these societies generally developed more ways of drawing productive talent from more people than did their competitors. Reenacting the Roman empire in Rome, April 2017   Alberto Lingria Xinhua / eyevi\u200bne / Redux   Throughout history, nations that share opportunity among their citizens have gained an edge over those that do not. Rome\u2019s policy of opening citizenship to conquered peoples and incorporating freed slaves into significant social roles gave it economic and military advantages. Likewise, the social mobility afforded by the United Kingdom and the United States gave these powers an advantage over more socially restrictive powers in continental Europe, contributing to their tremendous economic and scientific advancement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Researchers have also found ample evidence for the importance of shared opportunity in narrower, issue-specific studies: inequality is correlated with slower growth and stunted innovation, for instance, and its absence is associated with creativity, innovation, and thus economic growth. Another characteristic that stimulates national competitiveness is a shared and coherent national identity. The most competitive societies build their achievements on the foundation of a strong shared group identity\u2014in modern settings, a sense of nationhood. Not only does this shared identity help nations avoid the competitive handicaps of political and ethnic fragmentation and conflict, but it also enables them to rally popular support for competitive efforts. The historian David Landes articulated the power of a common and coherent national identity beautifully in  The Wealth and Poverty of Nations : Britain had the early advantage of being a nation. By that I mean not simply the realm of a ruler, not simply a state or political entity, but a self-conscious, self-aware unit characterized by common identity and loyalty and by equality of civil status. Nations can reconcile social purpose with individual aspirations and initiatives and enhance performance by their collective synergy. . . . Citizens of a nation will respond better to state encouragement and initiatives. . . . Nations can compete. This same dynamic has fueled the rise of many other competitive powers throughout history. For example, Japan\u2019s ascent to industrial and military prominence in both the Meiji and the  post\u2013World War II  periods was driven in part by a unifying national identity. That identity was always complicated by internal debates over the true nature of the Japanese character, but it nonetheless galvanized a national spirit of shared effort and sacrifice. Highly competitive societies also tend to benefit from some version of an active state: a coherent, powerful, goal-directed, and effective government that invests in national capabilities and beneficial societal qualities. Active states have taken different forms in different countries and in different eras, yet they have generally nurtured public and private institutions that are essential for economic success and social stability. That has meant underwriting state-led development, cultivating the private sector, assuring national stability, promoting strong education systems, ensuring sufficient markets for revolutionary technologies, and rallying national willpower at critical moments. The most obvious example of an active state generating competitive advantage is the United States, from its early industrial policy to later state support of research and development and specific technologies. The city-states of the Italian Renaissance and the modern United Kingdom and Japan are also good examples. By contrast, Habsburg Spain and the late  Ottoman Empire  never developed coherent, lasting approaches to sponsoring key elements of national power, and their competitiveness suffered as a result. Economists have cataloged dozens of ways in which active states have helped catalyze growth in modern nations.  Mariana Mazzucato , for instance, has shown how state support was critical for major advancements in information technology, green energy, and pharmaceuticals. The Internet and GPS technology both grew in part out of programs at the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and government support helped spawn dozens of other technologies, including nuclear power and advanced aviation systems. The active state in turn relies on another characteristic of competitive societies: effective social institutions. As the economists Daron Acemoglu, Douglass North, and James Robinson have demonstrated, strong and inclusive institutions foster economic growth, enhance the legitimacy of the state, respond to social challenges, and produce efficient military power. In the  United Kingdom , for instance, a centuries-old national parliament, strong financial sector, and powerful navy all contributed to the country\u2019s economic and geopolitical rise. The decline and eventual collapse of the Soviet Union, on the other hand, revealed what happens when institutions become corrupt and ineffective. As with all characteristics associated with competitive advantage, effective social institutions alone are not enough to explain national success or failure; to matter, they must be paired with broader values and habits. Most competitive societies share yet another characteristic: They tend to place a strong social emphasis on learning and adaptation. They are fired by the urge to create, explore, and learn. Instead of being shackled by orthodoxy and tradition, they embrace adaptation and experimentation and are open to innovations in public policy, business models, military concepts and doctrines, and art and culture. Throughout history\u2014from Athens to Rome to industrial Great Britain and the United States\u2014competitive success has been strongly correlated with widespread intellectual curiosity and commitment to learning. More recent studies provide evidence of a positive relationship between a commitment to modern technological education and growth and innovation, as well as one between educational attainment and growth. Graduating from the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, February 2011   Kieran Dodds / Panos Pictures / Re\u200bdux   Finally, most dynamic and competitive nations embody a significant degree of diversity and pluralism. A broad range of experiences and perspectives helps generate more ideas and talents that in turn sustain national power. Pluralism also strengthens organizations, such as firms and military branches, by forcing them to keep up with the competition. Diversity takes many forms: even ethnically and racially homogenous nations, such as the Victorian-era United Kingdom or contemporary Japan, can still produce wide political and commercial variety that drives national competitiveness. Diversity in the modern sense also promises potential competitive advantages. Melting-pot societies tend not to adopt the kinds of rigid orthodoxies that suppress competition and innovation, and their ability to assimilate foreigners makes it easier for them to attract talent from abroad. These advantages have helped many great powers rise and retain their competitive advantage, and their contribution to national vitality is corroborated by a mountain of empirical research on diversity in organizations. Each of these seven characteristics is associated with national competitiveness, but not even societies that boast all of them can be assured of long-term success. Nations that prevail in long-term competitions must achieve balance in each trait, since all of these advantages can spiral into excess and become liabilities. This is perhaps most true of national ambition, which can lead nations to overextend themselves. But it is also true of the other characteristics. Efforts to build an active state can, for example, produce a centralizing agenda that curdles into authoritarianism and intolerance. Effective institutions can become bloated and stifling bureaucracies. Too much pluralism can dissolve national unity. Most dynamic and successful nations have therefore sought all seven of the essential characteristics in healthy moderation. They have also enabled the characteristics to reinforce one another. The most potent advantage of each trait arises not from its individual consequences but from its combined effect with those of the others. National ambition and a culture of learning and adapting strongly reinforce each other, as do an active state and effective institutions. Shared opportunity must be combined with some diversity and pluralism to gain its true value. This recipe for national success, with mutually reinforcing ingredients, shows up in all the competitively dominant societies, allowing for differences in era and approach. It mixes strong state-supported national ambition with varied and diverse human capital, effective social institutions and rule of law, a spirit of shared national community, and a deeply felt reverence for experimentation and new ideas. In order for this recipe to produce competitive success, a society must have a public-spirited elite class. Nations gain tremendous competitive advantage from an active, public-minded elite that is representative of the broader society and connected to it via avenues of social mobility. But when a nation\u2019s elite, or much of it, becomes corrupt or engages in rent-seeking behavior, that nation\u2019s vibrancy, resilience, and competitive edge will erode. Crucially, the quality of a nation\u2019s elite plays a vital role in determining the legitimacy of its governing institutions. Where elites are seen as  corrupt  and self-interested rather than devoted to the public good, societies and the institutions that govern them often atrophy or break down. All this should give American leaders pause. In the second half of the twentieth century, the United States mastered the recipe for national competitiveness better than any nation in history. And even now, aspects of American society continue to exhibit strong elements of the seven essential characteristics: social mobility, diversity and political pluralism, in particular. Despite their troubles, moreover, U.S. government institutions from the local to the federal level still rank high in global evaluations of transparency and effectiveness. But there are also serious reasons for concern. If the United States continues on its current trajectory, it will risk weakening or even losing many of the traits that for the last 75 years have made it the world\u2019s dominant power. Four of the seven characteristics are especially at risk. One is national will and ambition. Survey evidence suggests that younger Americans do not view the United States, its values, or its ambitions in the same way as older Americans. A 2019 Eurasia Group Foundation survey, for example, found that fully 55 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 do not think the United States is \u201cexceptional,\u201d compared with only 25 percent of Americans over 60. Belief in American exceptionalism is not the same as ambition, of course, but it does indicate confidence in the national mission. Taken together with the many surveys that show growing popular skepticism about the need to project U.S. military power overseas, Americans\u2019 waning confidence in their national mission suggests a country that is less self-assured than it once was. Across a wide range of issues, polls reveal that Americans generally have less faith in the future and in their major political and social institutions than they have in half a century. Such survey results have always ebbed and flowed, and Americans have had little faith in some institutions, such as Congress, for many decades now. But on the whole, public opinion polls paint a picture of a nation that is no longer sure of itself, much less of its right and duty to impose its will on the world. The  United States\u2019  shared national identity may be in even greater peril. Increasingly, polling data and other observable trends\u2014such as \u201cassociative sorting,\u201d wherein people move to live closer to others with similar views\u2014suggest that the country is becoming divided into mutually suspicious camps with little common ground. This national fragmentation has been accelerated by a siloed information environment that allows disinformation and conspiracy theories to thrive. Storming the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C., January 2021   Ashley Gilbertson / VII / Redu\u200bx   Shared opportunity also shows signs of waning. Inequality is rising, and intergenerational mobility appears to be stalled. As the economist Raj Chetty and his collaborators at Harvard\u2019s Opportunity Insights project have shown, only half of young people today earn more than their parents did, compared with 90 percent of people born in 1940. Efforts to close opportunity gaps in areas such as access to venture capital have not been sufficient to reverse these troubling trends. At best, the level of shared opportunity has plateaued, and it may well be retreating after decades of progress. Finally, the spirit of learning and adaptation in the United States is increasingly threatened by the corrosive information environment. Competitive societies are information-processing organisms whose various components take insights about the world and turn them into behavior. Yet the U.S. information marketplace is being corrupted, in part because of the tremendous amounts of  misinformation  sloshing through social media, the sensationalism of the news media, the fragmentation of information sources, and the emergence of a \u201ctrolling\u201d ethic that encourages hostility and mean-spiritedness in public discourse. The United States continues to exhibit clear societal strengths. But data on issues as varied as the explosive rise of bureaucratic and administrative functions across many U.S. public and private institutions and the growing proportion of investment devoted to so-called value extraction, including via stock buybacks, suggest that the country may be living off the accumulated benefits of long-standing advantages rather than generating new competitive strengths. The United States displays some of the characteristics of a once dominant power that has passed its competitive prime: by some important measures, it is complacent, highly bureaucratized, and seeking short-term gains and rents rather than long-term productive breakthroughs. It is socially and politically divided, cognizant of the need for reforms yet unwilling or unable to make them, and suffering a loss of faith in the shared national project that once animated it. At the same time that the United States has allowed some of its societal strengths to atrophy, its closest rival\u2014China\u2014has  built up  tremendous societal strengths in some areas but also allowed potentially fatal weaknesses to fester in others. China clearly benefits from a potent national will and ambition, both domestically and internationally, and a unified national identity among much of the population. It has an active state that is pouring resources into human capital, research and development, high technology, and infrastructure. Its subnational governments theoretically offer platforms for vibrant, pluralistic experiments in social policy. China has a proud tradition of learning and education, and its governing institutions appear to have a high degree of legitimacy: in the 2022 Edelman Trust Barometer, an online survey of public opinion in 28 countries, China scored toward the top of the rankings for average levels of trust in nongovernmental organizations, business, government, and media. In some ways, therefore, China seems to be cultivating a powerful combination of essential characteristics for competitive success and positioning itself to leap ahead of the United States. Yet there are reasons to think  China  may falter. Opportunity there is widespread but still limited: inequality is growing, the World Economic Forum ranks China 106th out of 153 countries on gender equality, and young people are increasingly anxious about lack of social mobility. On the World Bank\u2019s Worldwide Governance Indicators, which measure quality of governance, China continues to lag behind the United States. China has little diversity and shows even less interest in embracing it. Most critically, China is not achieving a healthy balance of these essential characteristics. Its ambition is becoming excessive and self-defeating; its proud national identity could curdle into a xenophobic and exclusionary one that limits learning from abroad. The Chinese state is also becoming hyperactive, seeking to dominate all areas of social and economic life, choking off policy innovation and adaption, and imposing rigid orthodoxies that stifle free inquiry and innovation. These trends, along with other well-known challenges\u2014including a rapidly aging population and burgeoning debt\u2014should be red flags for China. For the United States, the warning signs come from the opposite direction, suggesting a once-dominant power congealing into immobility. Similar signs have preceded the decline of many other great powers and civilizations that lost their competitive standing. The process is a poisonous cycle, the mirror image of the positive reinforcement among beneficial traits that generates competitive advantage. Opportunity is hoarded. National willpower recedes as a society becomes self-satisfied and gripped by new orthodoxies, losing some its drive for international achievement and domestic intellectual, social, and scientific progress. Unity fragments under partisan or ideological pressures. Social institutions become weak and inept or authoritarian and overly bureaucratic. The active state seizes up and is unable to take bold action to solve problems or create new opportunities. To retain its competitive edge, the United States may need nothing less than a new national project to reinvigorate its essential characteristics. Our RAND study wasn\u2019t designed to generate specific policy proposals, but its findings hint at what such an initiative would require. Among other things, it should include a renewed commitment to ensuring that opportunity is shared and to unleashing the national creativity and power that reside in underserved and underachieving parts of the population. To cultivate a shared American identity, the United States must also find ways to celebrate American national community and spirit\u2014and unapologetically promote unifying themes of American history and culture\u2014while acknowledging the complexity of its past. And it will have to embrace a renewed, although limited and targeted, active role for the state by encouraging research, innovation, and new models of learning; wage war against bureaucratic excess and administrative constraints on creativity in the private and public sectors; and do more to combat misinformation and disinformation. Such an agenda would be thoroughly nonpartisan. Some of these needed initiatives\u2014those promoting a vibrant commercial market and a strong sense of national community and identity, for instance\u2014are often associated with conservative agendas. Others are more commonly seen as progressive priorities, including efforts to share opportunity more widely and empower an active state to shape markets for the public good. That there is something for everyone may be because the societal characteristics that drove the United States to predominance always reflected a productive and healthy combination of priorities from across the political spectrum: a nonpartisan view of American greatness that it is essential to recapture today. The challenges confronting the United States are very real. The threats posed by  China and Russia  should not be exaggerated, but both countries have goals that are antithetical to American interests and values and to the post\u2013World War II international order that has served the United States so well. But the prevailing view of what Washington must do in response\u2014redouble investments in military power and embrace a new campaign to contain Russian and Chinese power\u2014is at best only part of the answer. Such efforts could easily become counterproductive if they overextend the United States or yield new forms of domestic repression and orthodoxy. Far more important is a determined national effort to reinvigorate the qualities that made the United States the greatest engine of competitive dynamism in history. In 2005, the historian Kenneth Bartlett ended a series of lectures on the Italian Renaissance with a melancholy meditation on the causes of national stagnation and decline: The Renaissance ended because the sets of attitudes and beliefs and self-confidence, that energizing myth that [was] the motive power of the Renaissance mind, simply ceased to function. The Renaissance could not continue in the form that it had. It couldn\u2019t be sustained because ultimately the failure wasn\u2019t military or political or economic, although all of these provided the context of the truly great failure which was psychological: The failure of will, the failure to confront the crises that the Italians knew that they were in, the decision\u2014the hard decision, and the decision that is so natural in human nature\u2014to accept what is known and safe and stable. That fateful decision doused much of the intellectual fire that had fueled the period\u2019s remarkable progress. In Bartlett\u2019s words, it killed off the \u201cself-reinforcing energizing myth\u201d that had driven the Italians \u201cto do such great things, to extend human experience so far in such a short period of time.\u201d That source of greatness was much broader and more fundamental than economic growth or military might. It was the essential dynamism and vitality of a society. And when it suddenly evaporated, it left Italy without ambition or a commitment to learning, fearful of experimentation and innovation, and captured by elites concerned with power and profit above all else. The United States faces a strikingly similar peril today. The primary threat to U.S. dynamism and competitive standing comes not from without but from within: from changes in the character of American society. The next great challenge for the United States will be to stimulate a new era of competitive advantage, one that can revive the qualities that powered the country\u2019s rise in the last century as well as sustain them into the next. As it was for Italy at the end of the Renaissance, the ultimate question for the United States is not one of understanding or of capacity to tackle such an undertaking. The question is one of will: whether the United States has the reservoirs of creative determination, national solidarity, and political resolve to meet this weighty challenge.

What up to this point may have seemed like an abstract and inchoate challenge has suddenly become real, urgent, and perilous. In response, many U.S. officials and analysts have called for the United States to enhance its military capabilities, harden its defenses, and invest in key technologies. Washington must prepare to have its will tested again and again, they say, whether by proxy wars or by other challenges to the United States\u2019 network of alliances and security partnerships. Success in great-power competition, in this view, depends on accumulating victories in a series of individual contests for supremacy.@@History offers a different lesson. Nations do not prevail in enduring competitions chiefly by acquiring superior technological or military capabilities or even by imposing their will in every crisis or war. Great powers can make many mistakes\u2014lose wars, lose allies, even lose their military edge\u2014and still triumph in long-term contests. In the struggle for advantage among world powers, it is not military or economic might that makes the crucial difference but the fundamental qualities of a society: the characteristics of a nation that generate economic productivity, technological innovation, social cohesion, and national will.@@This is not a new insight, of course. American politicians, scholars, and pundits have for decades paid lip service to the idea that a dynamic and resilient home front is the foundation for success abroad. But behind such vague bromides are specific national qualities that social scientists can identify and measure. Over the course of 15 months, I led a RAND Corporation study for the U.S. Defense Department\u2019s Office of Net Assessment, supported by analysis from outside historians, that did exactly that. Drawing on historical case studies and research on economic development, technological advancement, and much else, we isolated a number of national characteristics that throughout history have underpinned national competitive success\u2014including a strong national ambition, a culture of learning and adaptation, and significant diversity and pluralism.@@These domestic strengths are the building blocks of international power. But to enable a country to succeed, they must reinforce and support one another. And they must not fall out of balance. Too much national ambition, for instance, can lead to overreach, imperiling the country that overcommits itself. But countries with too little ambition, diversity, or willingness to learn and adapt risk starting a negative cycle that can spiral into national decline. Today, the United States finds itself deficient in many of the qualities that powered its rise over the second half of the twentieth century. If it is to regain its competitive advantage\u2014and prevail in its current contests with @@ and @@\u2014it will have to do more than just outspend its rivals on defense or advanced military technologies. It will have to nurture the qualities that make great powers dynamic, innovative, and adaptive.@@On the eve of the Peloponnesian War in 432 BC, a delegation from Corinth traveled to Sparta in a last-ditch effort to prevent what would become a generational conflict. In his history of the war, Thucydides recounts how the Corinthians accused the Spartans, their allies, of turning a blind eye to the alarming growth of Athenian power. \u201cThe Athenians are addicted to innovation, and their designs are characterized by swiftness alike in conception and execution; you have a genius for keeping what you have got, accompanied by a total want of invention, and when forced to act, you never go far enough,\u201d the Corinthians complained. They continued: \u201cTo describe their character in a word, one might truly say that they were born into the world to take no rest themselves and to give none to others.\u201d Put differently, Athens posed a danger not primarily because of the size of its navy, the richness of its soil, or the number of its people. It stood to supplant Sparta as the dominant power for a broader and more encompassing reason: the superior qualities of its social and political system.@@A remarkably similar story unfolded some 2,000 years later. The United States ultimately prevailed over the Soviet Union in the Cold War because it was more energetic, innovative, productive, and legitimate. Indeed, some commentators made the comparison directly, casting Washington as the Athens of that drama to Moscow\u2019s lethargic, conservative Sparta. The lesson of both historical rivalries applies to nearly all contests between world powers. Almost always, nations rise and fall because of a complex and interlinked set of social characteristics that produce national dynamism and competitive advantage.@@Yet identifying these characteristics poses an analytic challenge. Most are abstract and ill defined. Many are also difficult, perhaps even impossible, to measure reliably, especially in historical cases where accurate data simply do not exist. In complex geopolitical interactions, tracing definitive causal relationships can be difficult or impossible. Partly as a result, many efforts to identify the factors underpinning dynamism and competitiveness have produced essentialist theories about national will or decadence or have posited the superiority of certain cultures.@@Any attempt to overcome this challenge must first define the yardstick for national success or failure. Measures of economic growth or indicators of technological innovation might seem like obvious answers. But these are intervening factors: economic growth is a source of national power to be sure, but it is also a product of more fundamental factors that generate economic development. The same is true of innovation, military sophistication, productivity, and many other common output measures of national power.@@An added complication is that some countries that score high on characteristics associated with national dynamism and competitiveness do not rise to the top of the global hierarchy. Some, such as the Netherlands and Singapore, are too small. Others, such as Sweden and South Korea, have lost or never had a drive for global leadership. Still, they generate economic growth, technological sophistication, high living standards, national cohesion, and many other outcomes associated with success. A related issue is that factors other than societal characteristics can make a critical difference in specific conflicts: Athens had more geopolitical power and long-term cultural influence than Sparta, but thanks in part to a devastating pandemic and strategic blunders such as its invasion of Sicily, it did lose the Peloponnesian War. What all this means is that any effort to identify advantageous societal qualities must consider absolute measures of national strength, such as longevity and ability to provide security and prosperity, and relative ones, such as success or failure in bilateral rivalries or standing on the world stage.@@Our RAND Corporation study looked at both. We examined the literature on the rise and fall of nations and on the sources of economic and technological progress, conducted a dozen major historical case studies, and supplemented that historical scholarship with more recent research on a variety of issues such as inequality, diversity, and national identity. We found that nations that demonstrate both absolute and relative forms of competitive success tend to reflect, either in specific periods of ascendancy or longer-term positions atop the global hierarchy, seven leading characteristics: a driving national ambition, shared opportunity for citizens, a common and coherent national identity, an active state, effective social institutions, an emphasis on learning and adaptation, and significant diversity and pluralism.@@The causal links between these characteristics and national competitive success, while generally consistent, vary across time and from country to country. And these are not the only variables associated with national success: other factors, such as natural disasters, pandemics, and geography, obviously matter. But a broad survey of the evidence suggests that these seven characteristics play an outsize role in determining the competitive fate of nations.@@The first essential characteristic\u2014arguably the foundation for all forms of relative national strength\u2014is some version of driving national ambition. Externally, this trait produces a sense of national mission and greatness and a desire to influence world politics. Internally, it generates a national drive to learn, achieve, and succeed in everything from scientific research to business and industry to the arts. Driving national ambition demands the commitment of a whole people to gain knowledge about and leverage over their world: to explore and control, to understand and direct. This impulse can easily go wrong. Excessive national ambition is a common route to failure, whether through destructive wars of choice or imperial conquests that overextend a nation\u2019s resources and provoke destructive reactions. But without such ambition, countries seldom build potent domestic economic or technological engines or prevail in relative contests for power.@@Much of the evidence for the importance of national ambition comes from the historical record and the nearly one-to-one relationship between competitive success and some version of this characteristic. Rome, for example, had a driving ambition: its rise to greatness during the middle and late Republic and early Empire and its supremacy over the major powers of its day were propelled by a powerful societal custom that valorized control, mastery, and conquest. Similar kinds of ambition, including the domestic urge for accomplishment and discovery, can be found in all highly competitive nations\u2014the United Kingdom, the United States, Meiji Japan, the city-states of the Italian Renaissance, and others. Deteriorating societies tend to reflect the withering of this adventurous spirit and everything that goes with it, including a thirst for improvement, an appetite for new knowledge, and a willingness to take risks.@@In addition to having a driving national ambition, highly competitive societies tend to share opportunities widely among their citizens. They offer many routes to success and exclude relatively few segments of their population from productive roles\u2014at least as compared with their main rivals. In so doing, they leverage a high proportion of their available talent and provide real prospects to a broad cross section of their population. Over time, societies that exhibit this trait have become more inclusive in various ways, including in granting full rights and opportunities to all social groups and in providing clear pathways to entrepreneurial and creative advancement. Rome, Meiji Japan, and even industrial-era Great Britain gained powerful advantage from versions of shared opportunity that would look incredibly restrictive to modern eyes. But by the standards of their time, these societies generally developed more ways of drawing productive talent from more people than did their competitors.@@Throughout history, nations that share opportunity among their citizens have gained an edge over those that do not. Rome\u2019s policy of opening citizenship to conquered peoples and incorporating freed slaves into significant social roles gave it economic and military advantages. Likewise, the social mobility afforded by the United Kingdom and the United States gave these powers an advantage over more socially restrictive powers in continental Europe, contributing to their tremendous economic and scientific advancement in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Researchers have also found ample evidence for the importance of shared opportunity in narrower, issue-specific studies: inequality is correlated with slower growth and stunted innovation, for instance, and its absence is associated with creativity, innovation, and thus economic growth.@@Another characteristic that stimulates national competitiveness is a shared and coherent national identity. The most competitive societies build their achievements on the foundation of a strong shared group identity\u2014in modern settings, a sense of nationhood. Not only does this shared identity help nations avoid the competitive handicaps of political and ethnic fragmentation and conflict, but it also enables them to rally popular support for competitive efforts. The historian David Landes articulated the power of a common and coherent national identity beautifully in @@:@@Britain had the early advantage of being a nation. By that I mean not simply the realm of a ruler, not simply a state or political entity, but a self-conscious, self-aware unit characterized by common identity and loyalty and by equality of civil status. Nations can reconcile social purpose with individual aspirations and initiatives and enhance performance by their collective synergy. . . . Citizens of a nation will respond better to state encouragement and initiatives. . . . Nations can compete.@@This same dynamic has fueled the rise of many other competitive powers throughout history. For example, Japan\u2019s ascent to industrial and military prominence in both the Meiji and the @@ periods was driven in part by a unifying national identity. That identity was always complicated by internal debates over the true nature of the Japanese character, but it nonetheless galvanized a national spirit of shared effort and sacrifice.@@Highly competitive societies also tend to benefit from some version of an active state: a coherent, powerful, goal-directed, and effective government that invests in national capabilities and beneficial societal qualities. Active states have taken different forms in different countries and in different eras, yet they have generally nurtured public and private institutions that are essential for economic success and social stability. That has meant underwriting state-led development, cultivating the private sector, assuring national stability, promoting strong education systems, ensuring sufficient markets for revolutionary technologies, and rallying national willpower at critical moments. The most obvious example of an active state generating competitive advantage is the United States, from its early industrial policy to later state support of research and development and specific technologies. The city-states of the Italian Renaissance and the modern United Kingdom and Japan are also good examples. By contrast, Habsburg Spain and the late @@ never developed coherent, lasting approaches to sponsoring key elements of national power, and their competitiveness suffered as a result.@@Economists have cataloged dozens of ways in which active states have helped catalyze growth in modern nations. @@, for instance, has shown how state support was critical for major advancements in information technology, green energy, and pharmaceuticals. The Internet and GPS technology both grew in part out of programs at the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and government support helped spawn dozens of other technologies, including nuclear power and advanced aviation systems.@@The active state in turn relies on another characteristic of competitive societies: effective social institutions. As the economists Daron Acemoglu, Douglass North, and James Robinson have demonstrated, strong and inclusive institutions foster economic growth, enhance the legitimacy of the state, respond to social challenges, and produce efficient military power. In the @@, for instance, a centuries-old national parliament, strong financial sector, and powerful navy all contributed to the country\u2019s economic and geopolitical rise. The decline and eventual collapse of the Soviet Union, on the other hand, revealed what happens when institutions become corrupt and ineffective. As with all characteristics associated with competitive advantage, effective social institutions alone are not enough to explain national success or failure; to matter, they must be paired with broader values and habits.@@Most competitive societies share yet another characteristic: They tend to place a strong social emphasis on learning and adaptation. They are fired by the urge to create, explore, and learn. Instead of being shackled by orthodoxy and tradition, they embrace adaptation and experimentation and are open to innovations in public policy, business models, military concepts and doctrines, and art and culture. Throughout history\u2014from Athens to Rome to industrial Great Britain and the United States\u2014competitive success has been strongly correlated with widespread intellectual curiosity and commitment to learning. More recent studies provide evidence of a positive relationship between a commitment to modern technological education and growth and innovation, as well as one between educational attainment and growth.@@Finally, most dynamic and competitive nations embody a significant degree of diversity and pluralism. A broad range of experiences and perspectives helps generate more ideas and talents that in turn sustain national power. Pluralism also strengthens organizations, such as firms and military branches, by forcing them to keep up with the competition. Diversity takes many forms: even ethnically and racially homogenous nations, such as the Victorian-era United Kingdom or contemporary Japan, can still produce wide political and commercial variety that drives national competitiveness.@@Diversity in the modern sense also promises potential competitive advantages. Melting-pot societies tend not to adopt the kinds of rigid orthodoxies that suppress competition and innovation, and their ability to assimilate foreigners makes it easier for them to attract talent from abroad. These advantages have helped many great powers rise and retain their competitive advantage, and their contribution to national vitality is corroborated by a mountain of empirical research on diversity in organizations.@@Each of these seven characteristics is associated with national competitiveness, but not even societies that boast all of them can be assured of long-term success. Nations that prevail in long-term competitions must achieve balance in each trait, since all of these advantages can spiral into excess and become liabilities. This is perhaps most true of national ambition, which can lead nations to overextend themselves. But it is also true of the other characteristics. Efforts to build an active state can, for example, produce a centralizing agenda that curdles into authoritarianism and intolerance. Effective institutions can become bloated and stifling bureaucracies. Too much pluralism can dissolve national unity. Most dynamic and successful nations have therefore sought all seven of the essential characteristics in healthy moderation.@@They have also enabled the characteristics to reinforce one another. The most potent advantage of each trait arises not from its individual consequences but from its combined effect with those of the others. National ambition and a culture of learning and adapting strongly reinforce each other, as do an active state and effective institutions. Shared opportunity must be combined with some diversity and pluralism to gain its true value. This recipe for national success, with mutually reinforcing ingredients, shows up in all the competitively dominant societies, allowing for differences in era and approach. It mixes strong state-supported national ambition with varied and diverse human capital, effective social institutions and rule of law, a spirit of shared national community, and a deeply felt reverence for experimentation and new ideas.@@In order for this recipe to produce competitive success, a society must have a public-spirited elite class. Nations gain tremendous competitive advantage from an active, public-minded elite that is representative of the broader society and connected to it via avenues of social mobility. But when a nation\u2019s elite, or much of it, becomes corrupt or engages in rent-seeking behavior, that nation\u2019s vibrancy, resilience, and competitive edge will erode. Crucially, the quality of a nation\u2019s elite plays a vital role in determining the legitimacy of its governing institutions. Where elites are seen as @@ and self-interested rather than devoted to the public good, societies and the institutions that govern them often atrophy or break down.@@All this should give American leaders pause. In the second half of the twentieth century, the United States mastered the recipe for national competitiveness better than any nation in history. And even now, aspects of American society continue to exhibit strong elements of the seven essential characteristics: social mobility, diversity and political pluralism, in particular. Despite their troubles, moreover, U.S. government institutions from the local to the federal level still rank high in global evaluations of transparency and effectiveness. But there are also serious reasons for concern. If the United States continues on its current trajectory, it will risk weakening or even losing many of the traits that for the last 75 years have made it the world\u2019s dominant power.@@Four of the seven characteristics are especially at risk. One is national will and ambition. Survey evidence suggests that younger Americans do not view the United States, its values, or its ambitions in the same way as older Americans. A 2019 Eurasia Group Foundation survey, for example, found that fully 55 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 do not think the United States is \u201cexceptional,\u201d compared with only 25 percent of Americans over 60. Belief in American exceptionalism is not the same as ambition, of course, but it does indicate confidence in the national mission. Taken together with the many surveys that show growing popular skepticism about the need to project U.S. military power overseas, Americans\u2019 waning confidence in their national mission suggests a country that is less self-assured than it once was. Across a wide range of issues, polls reveal that Americans generally have less faith in the future and in their major political and social institutions than they have in half a century. Such survey results have always ebbed and flowed, and Americans have had little faith in some institutions, such as Congress, for many decades now. But on the whole, public opinion polls paint a picture of a nation that is no longer sure of itself, much less of its right and duty to impose its will on the world.@@The @@ shared national identity may be in even greater peril. Increasingly, polling data and other observable trends\u2014such as \u201cassociative sorting,\u201d wherein people move to live closer to others with similar views\u2014suggest that the country is becoming divided into mutually suspicious camps with little common ground. This national fragmentation has been accelerated by a siloed information environment that allows disinformation and conspiracy theories to thrive.@@Shared opportunity also shows signs of waning. Inequality is rising, and intergenerational mobility appears to be stalled. As the economist Raj Chetty and his collaborators at Harvard\u2019s Opportunity Insights project have shown, only half of young people today earn more than their parents did, compared with 90 percent of people born in 1940. Efforts to close opportunity gaps in areas such as access to venture capital have not been sufficient to reverse these troubling trends. At best, the level of shared opportunity has plateaued, and it may well be retreating after decades of progress.@@Finally, the spirit of learning and adaptation in the United States is increasingly threatened by the corrosive information environment. Competitive societies are information-processing organisms whose various components take insights about the world and turn them into behavior. Yet the U.S. information marketplace is being corrupted, in part because of the tremendous amounts of @@ sloshing through social media, the sensationalism of the news media, the fragmentation of information sources, and the emergence of a \u201ctrolling\u201d ethic that encourages hostility and mean-spiritedness in public discourse.@@The United States continues to exhibit clear societal strengths. But data on issues as varied as the explosive rise of bureaucratic and administrative functions across many U.S. public and private institutions and the growing proportion of investment devoted to so-called value extraction, including via stock buybacks, suggest that the country may be living off the accumulated benefits of long-standing advantages rather than generating new competitive strengths. The United States displays some of the characteristics of a once dominant power that has passed its competitive prime: by some important measures, it is complacent, highly bureaucratized, and seeking short-term gains and rents rather than long-term productive breakthroughs. It is socially and politically divided, cognizant of the need for reforms yet unwilling or unable to make them, and suffering a loss of faith in the shared national project that once animated it.@@At the same time that the United States has allowed some of its societal strengths to atrophy, its closest rival\u2014China\u2014has @@ tremendous societal strengths in some areas but also allowed potentially fatal weaknesses to fester in others. China clearly benefits from a potent national will and ambition, both domestically and internationally, and a unified national identity among much of the population. It has an active state that is pouring resources into human capital, research and development, high technology, and infrastructure. Its subnational governments theoretically offer platforms for vibrant, pluralistic experiments in social policy. China has a proud tradition of learning and education, and its governing institutions appear to have a high degree of legitimacy: in the 2022 Edelman Trust Barometer, an online survey of public opinion in 28 countries, China scored toward the top of the rankings for average levels of trust in nongovernmental organizations, business, government, and media. In some ways, therefore, China seems to be cultivating a powerful combination of essential characteristics for competitive success and positioning itself to leap ahead of the United States.@@Yet there are reasons to think @@ may falter. Opportunity there is widespread but still limited: inequality is growing, the World Economic Forum ranks China 106th out of 153 countries on gender equality, and young people are increasingly anxious about lack of social mobility. On the World Bank\u2019s Worldwide Governance Indicators, which measure quality of governance, China continues to lag behind the United States. China has little diversity and shows even less interest in embracing it. Most critically, China is not achieving a healthy balance of these essential characteristics. Its ambition is becoming excessive and self-defeating; its proud national identity could curdle into a xenophobic and exclusionary one that limits learning from abroad. The Chinese state is also becoming hyperactive, seeking to dominate all areas of social and economic life, choking off policy innovation and adaption, and imposing rigid orthodoxies that stifle free inquiry and innovation. These trends, along with other well-known challenges\u2014including a rapidly aging population and burgeoning debt\u2014should be red flags for China.@@For the United States, the warning signs come from the opposite direction, suggesting a once-dominant power congealing into immobility. Similar signs have preceded the decline of many other great powers and civilizations that lost their competitive standing. The process is a poisonous cycle, the mirror image of the positive reinforcement among beneficial traits that generates competitive advantage. Opportunity is hoarded. National willpower recedes as a society becomes self-satisfied and gripped by new orthodoxies, losing some its drive for international achievement and domestic intellectual, social, and scientific progress. Unity fragments under partisan or ideological pressures. Social institutions become weak and inept or authoritarian and overly bureaucratic. The active state seizes up and is unable to take bold action to solve problems or create new opportunities.@@To retain its competitive edge, the United States may need nothing less than a new national project to reinvigorate its essential characteristics. Our RAND study wasn\u2019t designed to generate specific policy proposals, but its findings hint at what such an initiative would require. Among other things, it should include a renewed commitment to ensuring that opportunity is shared and to unleashing the national creativity and power that reside in underserved and underachieving parts of the population. To cultivate a shared American identity, the United States must also find ways to celebrate American national community and spirit\u2014and unapologetically promote unifying themes of American history and culture\u2014while acknowledging the complexity of its past. And it will have to embrace a renewed, although limited and targeted, active role for the state by encouraging research, innovation, and new models of learning; wage war against bureaucratic excess and administrative constraints on creativity in the private and public sectors; and do more to combat misinformation and disinformation.@@Such an agenda would be thoroughly nonpartisan. Some of these needed initiatives\u2014those promoting a vibrant commercial market and a strong sense of national community and identity, for instance\u2014are often associated with conservative agendas. Others are more commonly seen as progressive priorities, including efforts to share opportunity more widely and empower an active state to shape markets for the public good. That there is something for everyone may be because the societal characteristics that drove the United States to predominance always reflected a productive and healthy combination of priorities from across the political spectrum: a nonpartisan view of American greatness that it is essential to recapture today.@@The challenges confronting the United States are very real. The threats posed by @@ should not be exaggerated, but both countries have goals that are antithetical to American interests and values and to the post\u2013World War II international order that has served the United States so well. But the prevailing view of what Washington must do in response\u2014redouble investments in military power and embrace a new campaign to contain Russian and Chinese power\u2014is at best only part of the answer. Such efforts could easily become counterproductive if they overextend the United States or yield new forms of domestic repression and orthodoxy. Far more important is a determined national effort to reinvigorate the qualities that made the United States the greatest engine of competitive dynamism in history.@@In 2005, the historian Kenneth Bartlett ended a series of lectures on the Italian Renaissance with a melancholy meditation on the causes of national stagnation and decline:@@The Renaissance ended because the sets of attitudes and beliefs and self-confidence, that energizing myth that [was] the motive power of the Renaissance mind, simply ceased to function. The Renaissance could not continue in the form that it had. It couldn\u2019t be sustained because ultimately the failure wasn\u2019t military or political or economic, although all of these provided the context of the truly great failure which was psychological: The failure of will, the failure to confront the crises that the Italians knew that they were in, the decision\u2014the hard decision, and the decision that is so natural in human nature\u2014to accept what is known and safe and stable.@@That fateful decision doused much of the intellectual fire that had fueled the period\u2019s remarkable progress. In Bartlett\u2019s words, it killed off the \u201cself-reinforcing energizing myth\u201d that had driven the Italians \u201cto do such great things, to extend human experience so far in such a short period of time.\u201d That source of greatness was much broader and more fundamental than economic growth or military might. It was the essential dynamism and vitality of a society. And when it suddenly evaporated, it left Italy without ambition or a commitment to learning, fearful of experimentation and innovation, and captured by elites concerned with power and profit above all else.@@The United States faces a strikingly similar peril today. The primary threat to U.S. dynamism and competitive standing comes not from without but from within: from changes in the character of American society. The next great challenge for the United States will be to stimulate a new era of competitive advantage, one that can revive the qualities that powered the country\u2019s rise in the last century as well as sustain them into the next.

power need look no further than the response to Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine. The dramatic measures taken by the United States and its allies illustrate the potency of the purse. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that asset seizures, financial sanctions, oil embargoes, and bans on the sale of military hardware, oil drilling equipment, and commercial airliner parts will cause Russia\u2019s economy to contract by nearly nine percent in 2022, a decline nearly three times as large as the one that Russia suffered in 2020 as a result of COVID-19. It is hard to imagine a more striking demonstration of the power of economic sanctions. But anyone who wonders about the limits of economic power also need look no further than Russia. For all the damage that Western punitive moves have done, there is no indication that they can persuade the Kremlin to halt its war in  Ukraine  or even to modify its prosecution of the war. Two definitions of economic power together demonstrate its strengths and limitations. To paraphrase the economist Richard Cooper, economic power is the capacity to apply economic instruments to punish or reward another party. But another definition, as articulated by the political scientist F. S. Northedge, depicts economic power as the capacity of an individual, group, or government to use economic instruments to influence the decision-making of another actor, thereby causing the targeted party to modify its behavior. The United States and its  NATO  allies clearly possess economic power in Cooper\u2019s sense, in terms of the ability to use economic instruments to punish another party. It is less clear, however, that they are capable of exercising it in Northedge\u2019s sense, as a means of altering the behavior of an adversary. The United States has a long history of wielding economic instruments to achieve its foreign policy goals. Precedents can be found at least as far back as the Embargo Act of 1807, when U.S. President Thomas Jefferson blocked imports in an effort to push back against British and French interference in U.S. trade. But there is an equally long history recording the inability of such instruments to alter the fundamental behavior of another party. The 1807 embargo, for instance, failed to hurt British and French interests and fueled, rather than prevented, conflict between the United Kingdom and the United States, culminating in the War of 1812. Nor does exercising economic power necessarily induce political shifts: economic penalties and rewards rarely lead to regime change, for example. The application of economic power is changing in one crucial respect, however: the growing importance of international coordination. Economic power has always been more effective when exerted by a coalition of countries. But in a multipolar global economy, where essential goods and services can be sourced from an increasing number of national suppliers, the importance of coordination for effective application is greater still. Consider the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese exports, which were imposed solely by Washington and produced no significant changes in Beijing\u2019s economic behavior. The Biden administration surely had that failure in mind when it enlisted the support of a broad coalition of like-minded governments before imposing  sanctions  on Russia. Going forward, U.S. economic power will depend more and more on Washington\u2019s ability to foster unity in an increasingly fractured world. Economic power is typically framed as an alternative to military power. Escalating economic sanctions on Russia, for instance, have been presented as an alternative to fulfilling the Ukrainian government\u2019s request that NATO establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. This formulation is invoked to explain why governments, when embroiled in geopolitical conflicts, have increasingly turned to economic measures in recent decades rather than engaging in direct military conflict. Given the threat of  nuclear war , the risk of escalation in a military confrontation between major powers is simply too great. That risk has been sufficient to limit the incidence and extent of such direct confrontations, as well as to weaken the credibility of threats of military action. Economic measures, in contrast, can be surgically calibrated to limit the danger of escalation\u2014or so say their proponents. They can be aimed at specific banks, politicians, and businesses. They can be tailored to maximize the pain felt by key decision-makers and their political allies while sparing the general public. Few armies can deploy their hardware with comparable precision and avoid inflicting civilian casualties. In his 2009 book,  Power Rules , the foreign policy expert  Leslie Gelb  invoked these dissimilarities as explanations for \u201ctwo earthquaking historical trends: the declining utility of military power and the concomitant rise of international economic power.\u201d In practice, however, the relationship between economic and military power is more complex. For one thing, economic and military measures have sometimes served as complements rather than substitutes. In 1990, for instance, the UN Security Council, responding to Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, authorized an embargo broadly prohibiting trade with both countries. It later authorized the use of military force in implementing the embargo. A series of subsequent resolutions instructed states to use their armies, navies, and air forces to interdict ships or aircraft carrying cargo to Iraq or Kuwait. More recently, the use of economic sanctions against Russia has not precluded the provision of military assistance to  Ukraine ; rather, the two go hand in hand as essential components of a larger strategy to punish Russia for its aggression. Moreover, the idea that high-tech economic weapons will inflict pain exclusively on their intended targets is an illusion. The fact that Russia is on course to experience a nine percent fall in GDP, with an annual rate of consumer price inflation of around 20 percent, is an indication that the West\u2019s economic sanctions will hit not just Russian oligarchs but also ordinary  households . In other cases, countries have imposed economic sanctions to purposely inflict widespread pain. During World War I, for instance, the Allies imposed a comprehensive blockade against Germany, seeking to ratchet up pressure on the country by creating economic hardship for ordinary citizens. That blockade is estimated to have caused some 750,000 civilian deaths from malnutrition and disease. Notably, however, there is no evidence that civilian hardship played a role in the German high command\u2019s decision to end the war. In any case, the current economic sanctions against Russia have not come close to anything on the scale of a World War\u00a0I\u2013style blockade. They fall short even of the 1990 embargo against Iraq, which exempted only humanitarian assistance. The hope of some Western observers that the country might rise up against Russian President Vladimir Putin rests in part on the idea that Western sanctions will inflict widespread economic pain for which the Russian public will blame its leader, resulting in that leader\u2019s downfall.  History  suggests that this outcome is unlikely. The hope, in most cases, is that economic sanctions will serve as a deterrent. Leaders, the logic goes, will hesitate to embark on foreign policy adventures for fear that sanctions will galvanize public opinion against them and that this dissatisfaction will manifest itself on the streets and cost them votes. Unfortunately, authoritarian leaders who control their country\u2019s military, security apparatus, and media landscape are not subject to the whims of public opinion. The scholars Gary Hufbauer, Jeffrey Schott, Kimberly Ann Elliott, and Barbara Oegg found that sanctions are least effective, in the sense of changing a target\u2019s behavior, when levied against autocratic regimes. As the political scientists Jean-Marc Blanchard and Norrin Ripsman put it, sanctions are most likely to work when executive autonomy is limited or when the head of state is answerable to other government branches capable of channeling popular disaffection. The United States has repeatedly directed sanctions and related economic instruments against autocratic regimes, including in China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and Russia, among other states. It is not surprising that these efforts have met with limited success. A further limitation of sanctions, when levied against an important and interconnected economy, is that they inflict damage that reverberates  well beyond  the targeted country. The EU, for instance, was initially reluctant to sanction Russian banks during the early stages of the Ukraine crisis for fear of harming its own banks that have claims on the country. Germany has likewise resisted banning imports of Russian natural gas for fear of causing a domestic recession. Building the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline near\u00a0Kingisepp, Russia, June 2019   Anton\u00a0Vaganov / Reuters   Moreover, the impact of many economic measures may also be constrained by the adaptability of the global economy. The effect of a European ban on Russian oil and gas would be limited insofar as energy exports could be rerouted, via tanker or pipeline, to countries not participating in the ban. Russia could ship additional natural gas to China, which is not a party to the sanctions regime, through the Power of Siberia pipeline, the existing natural gas link between the two countries, which was running at less than full capacity before the war. China and Russia have also reached a 30-year deal in which Russia will supply gas to China via a new pipeline\u2014an agreement they formalized when Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the  Beijing Winter Olympics , just days before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine. The deal will have clear geopolitical consequences: China will rely more on Russian energy imports and less on Middle Eastern supplies, whereas western Europe will increasingly look to the Middle East, instead of Russia, to meet its energy needs. But thanks to China, the impact on the Russian economy of a European embargo on Russian energy will be limited. Commodities at large, beyond oil and gas, are fungible: they can be bought and sold on different markets. The implication is that economic power will be effective only when the countries exerting it form an encompassing coalition\u2014a trick that is easy to attempt but hard to pull off. Although holdouts offering the targeted country alternative sources of supply or demand can be threatened with secondary sanctions, their application would risk igniting a two-front economic war. This could inflict yet more damage on the sanctioning countries. It helps, of course, when a commodity required by the sanctioned country has only a small number of sources and when the governments of those source countries are allied. Advanced semiconductors and the equipment needed to produce them, for instance, can be sourced only from the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan. Earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department worked hard to ensure that their governments were onboard with its sanctions on Russia. (It didn\u2019t hurt that Russia was only a minor market for these places.) But whether lack of access to the latest generation of semiconductors will be enough to effect a change in Russian foreign and military policy is questionable. Sometimes, in a pinch, less advanced semiconductors sourced from other countries will do, as U.S. automakers learned during supply chain disruptions in 2021. This option suggests that even concentrated economic pressure can have limited bite. Other developments in the economic war against Russia similarly illustrate the limitations of economic power, given the increasingly multipolar structure of the world economy. Take, for instance, the ban on Russian banks from SWIFT, the communications network that financial institutions use to transmit information about transfers, transactions, and payments. The political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman, in their work on weaponized interdependence, celebrate SWIFT as an example of how certain states are able to leverage interdependence to coerce others. They observe that SWIFT is an all but exclusive conduit for instructions regarding cross-border financial transfers. Banning a country\u2019s banks, therefore, makes it difficult to pay for imports, whatever their source. The United States, Farrell and Newman observe, is better able than other countries to wield authority over SWIFT and leverage it as a tool of economic might. U.S. financial institutions are its largest set of national shareholders. The single largest share of bank-to-bank financial transfers is conducted in dollars and therefore involves U.S. banks. SWIFT operates data centers in the United States, exposing it to the long arm of the U.S. legal system. U.S. sanctions against SWIFT itself, which Congress has threatened in the past, would pose an existential threat to the network. Smaller, less financially consequential states, in contrast, find it harder to bend SWIFT to their will. Farrell and Newman therefore refer to SWIFT as an \u201casymmetric network structure.\u201d As they also observe, SWIFT is not an intergovernmental agency, as is the case, for example, with the Universal Postal Union. Rather, it is a cooperative of private financial institutions. Those private-sector entities regulate its economic power. Governments can enlist firms to do their bidding, of course. In wars, they do so by executive order. But whether they can order firms to stop doing business in a country because of, say, unsavory factory conditions or human rights violations is less certain. Whether companies will comply voluntarily is also unclear. Firms like keeping costs down. They find it difficult to seek new sources of products\u2014thereby incurring higher costs\u2014when their competitors fail to do the same. This last observation points to a key difference between military power and economic power: military power is concentrated, whereas economic power is disbursed. Armies are hierarchical. Soldiers follow commands from superiors. Battalions are instructed on how to coordinate. Market economies, on the other hand, are decentralized. Companies and households make decisions based on prices, profits, and values. When executives do not believe it is in their firm\u2019s interest to help the state in, say, ousting objectionable leaders or discouraging their foreign adventures, they are unlikely to contribute to their government\u2019s effort to leverage economic power to these ends. At the same time, executives care about their company\u2019s image, and they are often willing to exert their own economic power against foreign actors to protect their company\u2019s reputation elsewhere. Numerous companies terminated their business in Russia following  Putin\u2019s  invasion of Ukraine\u2014less, one suspects, out of sympathy for the besieged residents of Mariupol than for fear of how their customers would react to their profiting from continued Russian operations. The Russian case highlights an important point: economic power in the age of social media is rooted in public opinion and in consumers\u2019 purchasing power. A government that is unable to maintain popular momentum for a military campaign will likely be unable to sustain that campaign indefinitely. Public support is, if anything, even more essential to efforts to deploy economic power effectively. But the ban on Russian participation in SWIFT also reveals how actors can circumvent dependence on global networks. Economies are flexible; banks and firms regularly seek ways to avoid economic pinch points and find substitutes for scarce inputs. Before SWIFT transmitted its first message, in 1977, banks sent transfer instructions by telegraph and telex systems. This equipment still exists today, as does the Internet. Although these means of communication may be more costly and less secure than SWIFT, they can still be used to carry out the work of verifying details about consumer accounts and transmissions of funds. Iranian banks, for instance, remained able to do business with foreign banks, albeit at a cost, when they were cut off from SWIFT in 2012. Without other punitive measures, Russian banks will likely be able to do the same. Moreover, the governments of countries cut out of these networks, and other governments simply wary of suffering the same fate, can invest in alternatives. Aware of its dependence on SWIFT and the dollar, China has been promoting the cross-border use of its currency, the renminbi, and developing an alternative to SWIFT and Western bank clearing-houses known as the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). To the extent that it succeeds, China, and potentially other countries, such as Russia, will be able to conduct international transactions in renminbi and transfer funds between domestic and foreign banks using a platform operated by the People\u2019s Bank of China. This practice will eliminate the ability of the United States to use SWIFT to glean information about these countries\u2019 cross-border transactions and to impose costs on a country\u2019s banks and those doing business with them. The headquarters of the People's Bank of China, Beijing, May 2022   Jason Lee / Reuters   The People\u2019s Bank of China has been working to develop CIPS into a real alternative to the West\u2019s dollar-based clearing system since 2015. Seven years later, however, China\u2019s system is still far from an adequate substitute. The main U.S. clearing-house for large banking transactions, the Clearing House Interbank Payments System, known as CHIPS, processes 40 times as many transactions by value as does China\u2019s alternative and has nearly ten times as many participants. Despite the Chinese authorities\u2019 efforts to encourage cross-border use of the renminbi, the currency still accounts for barely two percent of global payments, a fraction of the dollar\u2019s 40 percent share. Ironically, these facts are known because CIPS still relies heavily on SWIFT\u2019s messaging system to send instructions regarding funds transfers to and from banks outside China. CIPS\u2019s potential should not be underestimated, however. Eventually, banks will install digital translators enabling them to use CIPS\u2019s Chinese-character-based messaging system, but that will take time. Similarly, the renminbi may one day come to rival the dollar as a vehicle for cross-border payments, although that may take decades. Still, governments\u2019 attempts to use existing networks and institutions to project economic power will cause rivals to redouble their efforts to develop alternatives. This is not an argument against relying on economic instruments. But it is a reminder that governments wielding their economic power aggressively will see others investing even more heavily in arrangements that render those instruments less powerful in the future. Policymakers continue to believe in the potential of economic pressure to sway foreign regimes and actors. Successive U.S. administrations, for instance, have deployed the United States\u2019 economic might in an effort to influence Chinese policy. The Trump administration slapped  tariffs  on Chinese goods to browbeat China into increasing its purchases of U.S. agricultural products. The Biden administration followed President Donald Trump\u2019s lead, prohibiting sales to China of high-tech equipment that could be used for surveillance purposes. In 2021, President Joe Biden issued an executive order denying 59 Chinese defense and surveillance technology firms access to U.S. investment in an effort to discourage the Chinese government from engaging in foreign intelligence activities abroad and committing human rights violations domestically. The one thing these initiatives have in common, besides seeking to leverage economic power, is their failure to induce discernible changes in Chinese policy. A study by the economist  Chad Bown  concluded that Trump\u2019s tariffs and the subsequent trade deal with Beijing led China to purchase exactly zero additional U.S. agricultural exports or any other extra U.S. exports. Denying China access to advanced U.S. technology has not prompted Beijing to back away from its surveillance activities. Prohibiting U.S. investment in defense-linked Chinese firms has not led China to modify its military posture, be it toward Taiwan or more generally. Counterfactuals are difficult. One can imagine that Beijing would have imported even less from the United States, that its human rights violations would be even more egregious, and that its military posture would be even more aggressive had the United States not used its economic power. But even if that is true, the best that can be said for these policies is that they prevented bad situations from getting worse. Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect economic instruments to bring about sharp changes in a strategic adversary\u2019s policies within a short period. Gelb, in  Power Rules , cautioned that economic power does not produce results expeditiously. \u201cEconomic power functions best when you permit it to proceed slowly,\u201d he wrote, \u201callowing it to act like the tide.\u201d Armies can employ blitzkrieg tactics, but treasury departments must eschew quick victories and stay the course. Economic power may also be more effective at encouraging behavioral and policy change when it takes the form of positive incentives and rewards for potential allies rather than sanctions and punishments for rivals. The Marshall Plan is the prototypical example of how economic resources can be used to encourage governments and societies to affiliate with a particular economic and geopolitical camp and align their policies accordingly. Trade deals may foster deeper economic relations among the signatories but also encourage closer cooperation on other, non-trade-related matters. China is vigorously pursuing such policies: witness its Belt and Road Initiative, designed to spread its foreign investment around Asia and the world, and its participation in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a market-access agreement that includes 15 Asia-Pacific countries but excludes the United States. The United States can and should exert its economic might for similar ends; if not, it may see its own power dwindle. Thus, the main threat to effective U.S. economic power comes from the United States itself\u2014from the danger that the country will once again turn inward economically and politically, as it did starting in 2017. Foreign trade and investment have always been a source of strength for the U.S. economy, and a country that is not economically strong cannot effectively wield economic power. At the same time, it is important to recognize that there is no fundamental reason why the United States should continue to play the dominant economic role that it did after World War II. Emerging markets will continue to emerge: a number of economic and demographic factors indicate that the United States will account for a shrinking share of global GDP over time. To effectively exercise economic power, therefore, the country will have to coordinate with others\u2014as it has done recently by cooperating with the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan on banning advanced semiconductor sales to Russia. The future of U.S. economic power will hinge, in large part, on whether there is  cooperation  between the United States and the single biggest emerging market, China. Chinese banks appear to have acceded to Western sanctions barring business with Russia, presumably for fear of provoking secondary sanctions. This result is an indication that economic power can be effective when it has a very specific focus\u2014in this case, limiting a specific set of transactions, namely those by banks, with a specific country. It is also a reminder that the United States derives much of its economic power from its engagement with the rest of the world. China\u2019s banks\u2014and government\u2014fear secondary sanctions precisely because business with their Western counterparts is so extensive and economically important. The application of such secondary sanctions\u2014or, more alarming, a direct confrontation over  Taiwan , leading to broader U.S. sanctions against China\u2014could cause that interdependence to unravel. China would retaliate with sanctions of its own, redouble its efforts to create self-standing economic and financial institutions, and demand that countries in its orbit operate exclusively through its institutions. The United States and its allies would presumably do likewise. U.S. economic leverage over China would diminish if the world bifurcated into rival camps, decreasing global interdependence. And that would be the least of Washington\u2019s worries. The unraveling of global supply chains would place the U.S. economy at risk. Were China to liquidate its dollar reserves, possibly in anticipation of the imposition of U.S. sanctions, it could precipitate a global financial crisis of unprecedented proportions. To ward off those disasters, Washington would do well to remember that there is power in numbers and that the road away from interdependence is a dead end.

The dramatic measures taken by the United States and its allies illustrate the potency of the purse. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that asset seizures, financial sanctions, oil embargoes, and bans on the sale of military hardware, oil drilling equipment, and commercial airliner parts will cause Russia\u2019s economy to contract by nearly nine percent in 2022, a decline nearly three times as large as the one that Russia suffered in 2020 as a result of COVID-19. It is hard to imagine a more striking demonstration of the power of economic sanctions.@@But anyone who wonders about the limits of economic power also need look no further than Russia. For all the damage that Western punitive moves have done, there is no indication that they can persuade the Kremlin to halt its war in @@ or even to modify its prosecution of the war.@@Two definitions of economic power together demonstrate its strengths and limitations. To paraphrase the economist Richard Cooper, economic power is the capacity to apply economic instruments to punish or reward another party. But another definition, as articulated by the political scientist F. S. Northedge, depicts economic power as the capacity of an individual, group, or government to use economic instruments to influence the decision-making of another actor, thereby causing the targeted party to modify its behavior. The United States and its @@ allies clearly possess economic power in Cooper\u2019s sense, in terms of the ability to use economic instruments to punish another party. It is less clear, however, that they are capable of exercising it in Northedge\u2019s sense, as a means of altering the behavior of an adversary.@@The United States has a long history of wielding economic instruments to achieve its foreign policy goals. Precedents can be found at least as far back as the Embargo Act of 1807, when U.S. President Thomas Jefferson blocked imports in an effort to push back against British and French interference in U.S. trade. But there is an equally long history recording the inability of such instruments to alter the fundamental behavior of another party. The 1807 embargo, for instance, failed to hurt British and French interests and fueled, rather than prevented, conflict between the United Kingdom and the United States, culminating in the War of 1812. Nor does exercising economic power necessarily induce political shifts: economic penalties and rewards rarely lead to regime change, for example.@@The application of economic power is changing in one crucial respect, however: the growing importance of international coordination. Economic power has always been more effective when exerted by a coalition of countries. But in a multipolar global economy, where essential goods and services can be sourced from an increasing number of national suppliers, the importance of coordination for effective application is greater still. Consider the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese exports, which were imposed solely by Washington and produced no significant changes in Beijing\u2019s economic behavior. The Biden administration surely had that failure in mind when it enlisted the support of a broad coalition of like-minded governments before imposing @@ on Russia. Going forward, U.S. economic power will depend more and more on Washington\u2019s ability to foster unity in an increasingly fractured world.@@Economic power is typically framed as an alternative to military power. Escalating economic sanctions on Russia, for instance, have been presented as an alternative to fulfilling the Ukrainian government\u2019s request that NATO establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine. This formulation is invoked to explain why governments, when embroiled in geopolitical conflicts, have increasingly turned to economic measures in recent decades rather than engaging in direct military conflict. Given the threat of @@, the risk of escalation in a military confrontation between major powers is simply too great. That risk has been sufficient to limit the incidence and extent of such direct confrontations, as well as to weaken the credibility of threats of military action.@@Economic measures, in contrast, can be surgically calibrated to limit the danger of escalation\u2014or so say their proponents. They can be aimed at specific banks, politicians, and businesses. They can be tailored to maximize the pain felt by key decision-makers and their political allies while sparing the general public. Few armies can deploy their hardware with comparable precision and avoid inflicting civilian casualties. In his 2009 book, @@, the foreign policy expert @@ invoked these dissimilarities as explanations for \u201ctwo earthquaking historical trends: the declining utility of military power and the concomitant rise of international economic power.\u201d@@In practice, however, the relationship between economic and military power is more complex. For one thing, economic and military measures have sometimes served as complements rather than substitutes. In 1990, for instance, the UN Security Council, responding to Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait, authorized an embargo broadly prohibiting trade with both countries. It later authorized the use of military force in implementing the embargo. A series of subsequent resolutions instructed states to use their armies, navies, and air forces to interdict ships or aircraft carrying cargo to Iraq or Kuwait. More recently, the use of economic sanctions against Russia has not precluded the provision of military assistance to @@; rather, the two go hand in hand as essential components of a larger strategy to punish Russia for its aggression.@@Moreover, the idea that high-tech economic weapons will inflict pain exclusively on their intended targets is an illusion. The fact that Russia is on course to experience a nine percent fall in GDP, with an annual rate of consumer price inflation of around 20 percent, is an indication that the West\u2019s economic sanctions will hit not just Russian oligarchs but also ordinary @@. In other cases, countries have imposed economic sanctions to purposely inflict widespread pain. During World War I, for instance, the Allies imposed a comprehensive blockade against Germany, seeking to ratchet up pressure on the country by creating economic hardship for ordinary citizens. That blockade is estimated to have caused some 750,000 civilian deaths from malnutrition and disease. Notably, however, there is no evidence that civilian hardship played a role in the German high command\u2019s decision to end the war.@@In any case, the current economic sanctions against Russia have not come close to anything on the scale of a World War\u00a0I\u2013style blockade. They fall short even of the 1990 embargo against Iraq, which exempted only humanitarian assistance. The hope of some Western observers that the country might rise up against Russian President Vladimir Putin rests in part on the idea that Western sanctions will inflict widespread economic pain for which the Russian public will blame its leader, resulting in that leader\u2019s downfall. @@ suggests that this outcome is unlikely.@@The hope, in most cases, is that economic sanctions will serve as a deterrent. Leaders, the logic goes, will hesitate to embark on foreign policy adventures for fear that sanctions will galvanize public opinion against them and that this dissatisfaction will manifest itself on the streets and cost them votes. Unfortunately, authoritarian leaders who control their country\u2019s military, security apparatus, and media landscape are not subject to the whims of public opinion. The scholars Gary Hufbauer, Jeffrey Schott, Kimberly Ann Elliott, and Barbara Oegg found that sanctions are least effective, in the sense of changing a target\u2019s behavior, when levied against autocratic regimes. As the political scientists Jean-Marc Blanchard and Norrin Ripsman put it, sanctions are most likely to work when executive autonomy is limited or when the head of state is answerable to other government branches capable of channeling popular disaffection. The United States has repeatedly directed sanctions and related economic instruments against autocratic regimes, including in China, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, and Russia, among other states. It is not surprising that these efforts have met with limited success.@@A further limitation of sanctions, when levied against an important and interconnected economy, is that they inflict damage that reverberates @@ the targeted country. The EU, for instance, was initially reluctant to sanction Russian banks during the early stages of the Ukraine crisis for fear of harming its own banks that have claims on the country. Germany has likewise resisted banning imports of Russian natural gas for fear of causing a domestic recession.@@Moreover, the impact of many economic measures may also be constrained by the adaptability of the global economy. The effect of a European ban on Russian oil and gas would be limited insofar as energy exports could be rerouted, via tanker or pipeline, to countries not participating in the ban. Russia could ship additional natural gas to China, which is not a party to the sanctions regime, through the Power of Siberia pipeline, the existing natural gas link between the two countries, which was running at less than full capacity before the war. China and Russia have also reached a 30-year deal in which Russia will supply gas to China via a new pipeline\u2014an agreement they formalized when Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the @@, just days before Russia launched its attack on Ukraine. The deal will have clear geopolitical consequences: China will rely more on Russian energy imports and less on Middle Eastern supplies, whereas western Europe will increasingly look to the Middle East, instead of Russia, to meet its energy needs. But thanks to China, the impact on the Russian economy of a European embargo on Russian energy will be limited.@@Commodities at large, beyond oil and gas, are fungible: they can be bought and sold on different markets. The implication is that economic power will be effective only when the countries exerting it form an encompassing coalition\u2014a trick that is easy to attempt but hard to pull off. Although holdouts offering the targeted country alternative sources of supply or demand can be threatened with secondary sanctions, their application would risk igniting a two-front economic war. This could inflict yet more damage on the sanctioning countries.@@It helps, of course, when a commodity required by the sanctioned country has only a small number of sources and when the governments of those source countries are allied. Advanced semiconductors and the equipment needed to produce them, for instance, can be sourced only from the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan. Earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department worked hard to ensure that their governments were onboard with its sanctions on Russia. (It didn\u2019t hurt that Russia was only a minor market for these places.) But whether lack of access to the latest generation of semiconductors will be enough to effect a change in Russian foreign and military policy is questionable. Sometimes, in a pinch, less advanced semiconductors sourced from other countries will do, as U.S. automakers learned during supply chain disruptions in 2021. This option suggests that even concentrated economic pressure can have limited bite.@@Other developments in the economic war against Russia similarly illustrate the limitations of economic power, given the increasingly multipolar structure of the world economy. Take, for instance, the ban on Russian banks from SWIFT, the communications network that financial institutions use to transmit information about transfers, transactions, and payments. The political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman, in their work on weaponized interdependence, celebrate SWIFT as an example of how certain states are able to leverage interdependence to coerce others. They observe that SWIFT is an all but exclusive conduit for instructions regarding cross-border financial transfers. Banning a country\u2019s banks, therefore, makes it difficult to pay for imports, whatever their source.@@The United States, Farrell and Newman observe, is better able than other countries to wield authority over SWIFT and leverage it as a tool of economic might. U.S. financial institutions are its largest set of national shareholders. The single largest share of bank-to-bank financial transfers is conducted in dollars and therefore involves U.S. banks. SWIFT operates data centers in the United States, exposing it to the long arm of the U.S. legal system. U.S. sanctions against SWIFT itself, which Congress has threatened in the past, would pose an existential threat to the network. Smaller, less financially consequential states, in contrast, find it harder to bend SWIFT to their will. Farrell and Newman therefore refer to SWIFT as an \u201casymmetric network structure.\u201d@@As they also observe, SWIFT is not an intergovernmental agency, as is the case, for example, with the Universal Postal Union. Rather, it is a cooperative of private financial institutions. Those private-sector entities regulate its economic power. Governments can enlist firms to do their bidding, of course. In wars, they do so by executive order. But whether they can order firms to stop doing business in a country because of, say, unsavory factory conditions or human rights violations is less certain. Whether companies will comply voluntarily is also unclear. Firms like keeping costs down. They find it difficult to seek new sources of products\u2014thereby incurring higher costs\u2014when their competitors fail to do the same.@@This last observation points to a key difference between military power and economic power: military power is concentrated, whereas economic power is disbursed. Armies are hierarchical. Soldiers follow commands from superiors. Battalions are instructed on how to coordinate. Market economies, on the other hand, are decentralized. Companies and households make decisions based on prices, profits, and values. When executives do not believe it is in their firm\u2019s interest to help the state in, say, ousting objectionable leaders or discouraging their foreign adventures, they are unlikely to contribute to their government\u2019s effort to leverage economic power to these ends.@@At the same time, executives care about their company\u2019s image, and they are often willing to exert their own economic power against foreign actors to protect their company\u2019s reputation elsewhere. Numerous companies terminated their business in Russia following @@ invasion of Ukraine\u2014less, one suspects, out of sympathy for the besieged residents of Mariupol than for fear of how their customers would react to their profiting from continued Russian operations. The Russian case highlights an important point: economic power in the age of social media is rooted in public opinion and in consumers\u2019 purchasing power. A government that is unable to maintain popular momentum for a military campaign will likely be unable to sustain that campaign indefinitely. Public support is, if anything, even more essential to efforts to deploy economic power effectively.@@But the ban on Russian participation in SWIFT also reveals how actors can circumvent dependence on global networks. Economies are flexible; banks and firms regularly seek ways to avoid economic pinch points and find substitutes for scarce inputs. Before SWIFT transmitted its first message, in 1977, banks sent transfer instructions by telegraph and telex systems. This equipment still exists today, as does the Internet. Although these means of communication may be more costly and less secure than SWIFT, they can still be used to carry out the work of verifying details about consumer accounts and transmissions of funds. Iranian banks, for instance, remained able to do business with foreign banks, albeit at a cost, when they were cut off from SWIFT in 2012. Without other punitive measures, Russian banks will likely be able to do the same.@@Moreover, the governments of countries cut out of these networks, and other governments simply wary of suffering the same fate, can invest in alternatives. Aware of its dependence on SWIFT and the dollar, China has been promoting the cross-border use of its currency, the renminbi, and developing an alternative to SWIFT and Western bank clearing-houses known as the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). To the extent that it succeeds, China, and potentially other countries, such as Russia, will be able to conduct international transactions in renminbi and transfer funds between domestic and foreign banks using a platform operated by the People\u2019s Bank of China. This practice will eliminate the ability of the United States to use SWIFT to glean information about these countries\u2019 cross-border transactions and to impose costs on a country\u2019s banks and those doing business with them.@@The People\u2019s Bank of China has been working to develop CIPS into a real alternative to the West\u2019s dollar-based clearing system since 2015. Seven years later, however, China\u2019s system is still far from an adequate substitute. The main U.S. clearing-house for large banking transactions, the Clearing House Interbank Payments System, known as CHIPS, processes 40 times as many transactions by value as does China\u2019s alternative and has nearly ten times as many participants. Despite the Chinese authorities\u2019 efforts to encourage cross-border use of the renminbi, the currency still accounts for barely two percent of global payments, a fraction of the dollar\u2019s 40 percent share. Ironically, these facts are known because CIPS still relies heavily on SWIFT\u2019s messaging system to send instructions regarding funds transfers to and from banks outside China. CIPS\u2019s potential should not be underestimated, however. Eventually, banks will install digital translators enabling them to use CIPS\u2019s Chinese-character-based messaging system, but that will take time. Similarly, the renminbi may one day come to rival the dollar as a vehicle for cross-border payments, although that may take decades.@@Still, governments\u2019 attempts to use existing networks and institutions to project economic power will cause rivals to redouble their efforts to develop alternatives. This is not an argument against relying on economic instruments. But it is a reminder that governments wielding their economic power aggressively will see others investing even more heavily in arrangements that render those instruments less powerful in the future.@@Policymakers continue to believe in the potential of economic pressure to sway foreign regimes and actors. Successive U.S. administrations, for instance, have deployed the United States\u2019 economic might in an effort to influence Chinese policy. The Trump administration slapped @@ on Chinese goods to browbeat China into increasing its purchases of U.S. agricultural products. The Biden administration followed President Donald Trump\u2019s lead, prohibiting sales to China of high-tech equipment that could be used for surveillance purposes. In 2021, President Joe Biden issued an executive order denying 59 Chinese defense and surveillance technology firms access to U.S. investment in an effort to discourage the Chinese government from engaging in foreign intelligence activities abroad and committing human rights violations domestically.@@The one thing these initiatives have in common, besides seeking to leverage economic power, is their failure to induce discernible changes in Chinese policy. A study by the economist @@ concluded that Trump\u2019s tariffs and the subsequent trade deal with Beijing led China to purchase exactly zero additional U.S. agricultural exports or any other extra U.S. exports. Denying China access to advanced U.S. technology has not prompted Beijing to back away from its surveillance activities. Prohibiting U.S. investment in defense-linked Chinese firms has not led China to modify its military posture, be it toward Taiwan or more generally.@@Counterfactuals are difficult. One can imagine that Beijing would have imported even less from the United States, that its human rights violations would be even more egregious, and that its military posture would be even more aggressive had the United States not used its economic power. But even if that is true, the best that can be said for these policies is that they prevented bad situations from getting worse.@@Perhaps it is unrealistic to expect economic instruments to bring about sharp changes in a strategic adversary\u2019s policies within a short period. Gelb, in @@, cautioned that economic power does not produce results expeditiously. \u201cEconomic power functions best when you permit it to proceed slowly,\u201d he wrote, \u201callowing it to act like the tide.\u201d Armies can employ blitzkrieg tactics, but treasury departments must eschew quick victories and stay the course.@@Economic power may also be more effective at encouraging behavioral and policy change when it takes the form of positive incentives and rewards for potential allies rather than sanctions and punishments for rivals. The Marshall Plan is the prototypical example of how economic resources can be used to encourage governments and societies to affiliate with a particular economic and geopolitical camp and align their policies accordingly. Trade deals may foster deeper economic relations among the signatories but also encourage closer cooperation on other, non-trade-related matters. China is vigorously pursuing such policies: witness its Belt and Road Initiative, designed to spread its foreign investment around Asia and the world, and its participation in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a market-access agreement that includes 15 Asia-Pacific countries but excludes the United States. The United States can and should exert its economic might for similar ends; if not, it may see its own power dwindle.@@Thus, the main threat to effective U.S. economic power comes from the United States itself\u2014from the danger that the country will once again turn inward economically and politically, as it did starting in 2017. Foreign trade and investment have always been a source of strength for the U.S. economy, and a country that is not economically strong cannot effectively wield economic power. At the same time, it is important to recognize that there is no fundamental reason why the United States should continue to play the dominant economic role that it did after World War II. Emerging markets will continue to emerge: a number of economic and demographic factors indicate that the United States will account for a shrinking share of global GDP over time. To effectively exercise economic power, therefore, the country will have to coordinate with others\u2014as it has done recently by cooperating with the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan on banning advanced semiconductor sales to Russia.@@The future of U.S. economic power will hinge, in large part, on whether there is @@ between the United States and the single biggest emerging market, China. Chinese banks appear to have acceded to Western sanctions barring business with Russia, presumably for fear of provoking secondary sanctions. This result is an indication that economic power can be effective when it has a very specific focus\u2014in this case, limiting a specific set of transactions, namely those by banks, with a specific country. It is also a reminder that the United States derives much of its economic power from its engagement with the rest of the world. China\u2019s banks\u2014and government\u2014fear secondary sanctions precisely because business with their Western counterparts is so extensive and economically important.@@The application of such secondary sanctions\u2014or, more alarming, a direct confrontation over @@, leading to broader U.S. sanctions against China\u2014could cause that interdependence to unravel. China would retaliate with sanctions of its own, redouble its efforts to create self-standing economic and financial institutions, and demand that countries in its orbit operate exclusively through its institutions. The United States and its allies would presumably do likewise. U.S. economic leverage over China would diminish if the world bifurcated into rival camps, decreasing global interdependence.@@And that would be the least of Washington\u2019s worries. The unraveling of global supply chains would place the U.S. economy at risk. Were China to liquidate its dollar reserves, possibly in anticipation of the imposition of U.S. sanctions, it could precipitate a global financial crisis of unprecedented proportions. To ward off those disasters, Washington would do well to remember that there is power in numbers and that the road away from interdependence is a dead end.", "download_timeout": 180.0,

infrastructure investment project through which China has financed and built bridges, ports, power plants, railways, tunnels, and 5G wireless networks around the world. The initiative has not only expanded China\u2019s footprint but also indebted more global leaders to Beijing, in a literal sense: Chinese banks provide the finances to pay for this infrastructure. In June 2021, at the G-7 meeting held in the United Kingdom, U.S. President Joe Biden unveiled the West\u2019s response to the program: the Build Back Better World initiative, also known as B3W. Biden promised that it would help \u201cmeet the enormous infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries,\u201d with a particular focus on addressing climate, digital infrastructure, gender-equality, and health issues. The president offered few details about what exactly B3W would encompass, but the initiative was clearly pitched as a Western alternative to the Belt and Road Initiative. Since then, however, B3W has languished. Even the name has been scrapped, a casualty of legislative demise of the Build Back Better bill, the U.S. domestic legislative proposal that encompassed priorities  as varied as environmental protection, reducing prescription drug prices, and universal preschool.  A rebrand to \u201cPartnership for Global Infrastructure\u201d is underway. Still, some B3W projects were announced in the spring of 2022. The\u00a0Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity Partnership will provide $3.45 million this year in U.S. government funding for digital finance and Internet service providers; a $2.3 million set of grants has been made available to small solar energy providers; and the Biden administration will provide up to $50 million over five years to a World Bank trust fund trying to expand childcare\u2014if Congress allocates the resources. Surely these are worthy expenditures, but what they mean is that about a year after Biden announced B3W, his administration\u2019s commitments to the cause of global infrastructure renewal add up to a paltry $6 million. Even if Congress allocates the additional $50 million, that\u2019s a far cry from the billions Biden promised in his original announcement.  This poor showing is no great loss, however, because B3W is the wrong approach to competing with China in the developing world. The United States is notoriously bad at investing in and maintaining its own physical infrastructure, so it never made sense for it to try to build infrastructure projects abroad. Those activities are best left to the multilateral economic institutions in which the United States plays a leading role, namely the World Bank and regional multilateral banks such as the African Development Bank. In a bilateral  competition  with China, Washington should play to its strengths, including leveraging its unparalleled system of higher education. The good news is that schooling the next generation of global leaders, rather than playing catch-up with Chinese construction firms, would be a win not just for the United States\u2019 global standing but for the U.S. economy, as well. Breaking Ground When the Biden administration launched B3W, officials were   careful not to describe it as a bid for a head-to-head matchup with China, no doubt worried that the showcase global initiative would be seen as a purely defensive move. Yet as one official put it at B3W\u2019s unveiling in the United Kingdom, \u201cUntil now we have not offered a positive alternative that reflects our values, our standards and our way of doing business.\u201d That alternative would stand in contrast to a Chinese model that advantages Chinese firms by linking loans to contracts.  The idea that the United States hasn\u2019t offered a \u201cpositive alternative\u201d in the past is odd. In the last decade alone, the United States has launched Power Africa,  a program aimed at providing electricity to millions of households in the region; the Blue Dot  Network, in which  Australia, Japan, and  the United States  collaboratively promote global sustainable infrastructure development; and Enhancing Development and Growth Through Energy, an initiative that helps governments in the Indo-Pacific region expand energy access. These projects differed from  Belt and Road  in that the United States committed very little money, and most of the funds that were allocated were invested in private companies. Sadly, the current iteration of B3W wouldn\u2019t change that dynamic at all.  It\u2019s not just scale that places the United States at a comparative disadvantage in infrastructure construction. China is better at building, not just domestically but across the globe. Chinese firms dominate the competitive procurement of leading infrastructure lenders such as the World Bank. They won $2.3 billion worth of World Bank\u2013financed infrastructure contracts outside China in 2020, compared to the United States\u2019 $27 million worth of contracts. Of the 20 largest construction contractors, 14 are in China, six are in Europe, and none are in the United States. China owes its dominance partly to government subsidies, but on balance, that\u2019s a good deal for developing countries who are effectively receiving handouts from Chinese taxpayers. U.S. policymakers may claim that Chinese subsidies are unfair, but those complaints will fall on deaf ears in the countries that benefit from China\u2019s largess.  But the gravest flaw of B3W is that it appears to be based on the very model of self-dealing capitalism for which the U.S. government has condemned China. The main components of the Biden administration\u2019s strategy for competing economically with China involve subsidies to  American companies. USAID spends most of its resources buying goods and services from U.S. firms. The Bipartisan Innovation Act  would  also provide billions in industry subsidies to ramp up U.S. semiconductor production . Worse, the  U.S. response is being copied by its ally the United Kingdom. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is redirecting aid spending toward programs that use \u201cworld-class British expertise,\u201d as the British Foreign Office generously described the approach as part of its aid strategy this past May. Perhaps other G-7 members will follow in their wake: certainly the European Union is looking for ways to disburse billions in subsidies to European firms planning to invest in developing countries.  The situation recalls the beginning of the  Cold War , when  Soviet leader Joseph Stalin launched the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance as an answer to American-led economic programs such as the Marshall Plan, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. Sold as a way to foster economic cooperation among the countries of the Eastern bloc, Comecon actually  reduced overall trade flows of member countries by putting up barriers to exports and imports with the rest of the world. This time around, in response to a far more robust version offered by China, it is the United States that is providing a Potemkin model of international cooperation. Adding to the irony, the institutions created at the  Bretton Woods Conference that Stalin was attempting to counter are what make B3W\u2019s infrastructure push unnecessary. The administration should work through those organizations to attempt to achieve its aims. In Plain Sight The obvious actor to lead on delivering sustainable infrastructure at scale in the developing world is not the White House but an entity that sits just three blocks away: the World Bank. The bank has long championed market-driven approaches to development and supports billions of dollars of infrastructure investments in low- and middle-income countries each year. It enforces procurement rules that encourage transparency and international competition (the so-called \u201clevel playing field\u201d), and it leverages as much as $46 of private-sector-backed financing for each dollar of public funding supplied by governments. Instead of pursuing a bilateral infrastructure agenda deal by deal across the developing world, the Biden administration should focus on channeling more of its aid money through these multilateral institutions.  If the administration really wants a bilateral global development competition with China, the United States should play to its strengths: not Amtrak but Ann Arbor, not Newark but Notre Dame. The higher education system in the United States is the envy of the world, one that has schooled business and political leaders from almost every country on the planet. China is trying to copy the model, but the United States still has a two-to-one lead in foreign student enrollees, including many students from China itself. In recent years, of course, the U.S. government has neglected public research budgets and diminished the flow of foreign students into American schools. That process began under President Donald Trump, but President Biden hasn\u2019t done enough to change course. This is a devastating error, but one that the Biden administration could address by cutting wait times for appointments to apply for a student visa, which can stretch a year or longer; supporting the Fulbright program, which provides scholarships and fellowships both for Americans to study and research abroad as well as for foreign scholars to come to the United States; and providing non-Americans access   to federal student loan programs. To demonstrate support for international competition, the United States could also add to its financing for companies that provide loans to students from low- and middle-income countries to study abroad in the country of their choice. One such company, Prodigy Finance, is already backed by the U.S. Development Finance Corporation.   The great advantage of strategic competition based on human capital is that it will benefit the United States: along with demonstrating openness and building a network of sympathetic global leaders, students who choose to come to the United States sometimes stay, becoming a vital part of the country\u2019s research and entrepreneurial capacity. Rather than trying to beat China at its own game, the United States needs to recommit to a vision of planetary prosperity through global cooperation, openness, transparency, and equal opportunity. When it comes to physical capital, the World Bank and regional development banks are best suited to accomplish those goals. When it comes to human capital, the United States can and should take the lead, reopening its doors to students and scholars. This agenda is truly values-driven in a way that B3W could only ever hope to be. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

Wade , the 1973 case granting access to abortion. Eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion will lead to bans in half of U.S. states. The decision, while widely expected, is devastating to abortion rights supporters nonetheless. Since a draft of the opinion was leaked in May, thousands of people in communities across the United States have marched in protest. Among the chants and signs was a new symbol: the green handkerchief. Originating in Argentina, green bandanas have become ubiquitous among reproductive rights activists across Latin America. The handkerchiefs are a reminder that, whereas the United States has now repealed the 49-year-old ruling that legalized abortion at the federal level, parts of Latin America are moving in the opposite direction. Just five years ago, 97 percent of women in Latin America and the Caribbean lived in countries where abortion was illegal or severely restricted (the only exceptions were Cuba, Guyana, Uruguay, and the federal district of Mexico City). The region was home to some of the most draconian abortion bans in the world\u2014policies that endure in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Suriname. But over the past two years, the three most populous Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America decriminalized abortion in rapid succession\u2014first Argentina, then Mexico, and most recently Colombia. Other countries are on the brink of dramatic change, as well. Until recently, abortion in Chile was prohibited in all circumstances, owing to a law instituted in 1989 by the dictator General Augusto Pinochet as he left office. In 2017, a reform introduced certain narrow exceptions. Now Chile may make global history. A draft of the country\u2019s new constitution includes an article enshrining abortion rights\u2014apparently the most explicit such protection of any constitution in the world. These remarkable strides reflect decades of struggle. The hostile political environments and dire state of reproductive rights in the region required Latin American activists to organize across borders, form strategic alliances within their own countries, and explore ways to expand safe abortion access at the margins of the law. Against seemingly long odds, their efforts ultimately led to decriminalization. As the United States confronts a  reversal of rights  once considered untouchable, it is worth considering the lessons that Latin American feminists\u2019 experiences may hold. Even faced with hostile politics, a movement that brings together a diverse array of social groups with a stake in abortion rights can, in the end, achieve change.\u00a0 Latin America has a long history of women\u2019s rights activism. In 1981, more than 200 women from across the region gathered in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, at the first Encuentro Feminista Latinoamericano y del Caribe. Held every two to three years, the meetings served as a springboard for a new wave of feminist activism in the region. The Encuentros, as they became known, created a space for activists and organizers to discuss issues, share experiences, and work through ideological and organizational conflicts. In sometimes heated discussions and intense late-night sessions, participants in the Encuentros debated strategy, generated resolutions, and found friendship and solidarity. These exchanges shaped feminist agendas within individual countries and built networks across them. It was a seemingly unpropitious moment for women\u2019s rights. Across the hemisphere, democracy was under assault and military governments and death squads waged dirty wars on civil society. At a time when political dissidents in many countries were being exiled or murdered, there was little room for social organizing of any kind, much less with the goal of progressive change.\u00a0 The dire political circumstances shaped feminists\u2019 approaches. Rather than treating their cause as a separate, special issue, activists pushed for the end of dictatorial regimes and insisted that women\u2019s rights were  inextricable  from the wider struggle for human rights, justice, and democracy. In this view, authoritarian states are the ultimate  patriarchy , and such societies must therefore work to achieve, in the formulation popularized by Chilean feminist Julieta Kirkwood, \u201cdemocracy in the nation and in the home.\u201d Feminists worked with popular and human rights movements, Black and indigenous organizations, and trade unions, influencing the ideas and strategies of these movements and being influenced by them in turn. In highly unequal societies, Latin American feminists were forced to contend with differences across class and race. In the first decades of the twentieth century, socialist and anarchist feminists put working women and their interests at the center of discussions of women\u2019s rights. Later, in the 1970 and 1980s, feminists struggled inside leftist parties and organizations, where gender and reproductive rights were often dismissed as imperialist diversions from the real issue: class struggle. To contend with this resistance, feminists concentrated on introducing gender into discussions of class. At the Encuentros, tensions emerged between educated middle-class women who self-identified as feminists and poor and working-class members of grassroots women\u2019s organizations. Black and indigenous women insisted on representation and on introducing race and ethnicity into conversations about class and gender. The politics could be contentious, but Latin American feminist movements emerged from these conflicts stronger and more inclusive. Early Encuentros embraced reproductive rights, but the fifth meeting, held in San Bernardo, Argentina, in 1990, was an inflection point. Latin America had the highest rates of unsafe abortions in the world\u2014and high levels of maternal mortality as a result. A resolution at the Encuentro  declared  \u201cinvoluntary motherhood . . . a form of slavery\u201d and designated September 28 as the Day of Abortion Rights for Women in Latin America and the Caribbean. (The date commemorates the passage of the Brazilian Free Womb Law of 1871, when children born to enslaved women were declared free.) Participants founded a regional campaign for the right to abortion with coordination among different organizations in each country. By 2011, that regional network had gone global; today, September 28 is recognized as International Safe Abortion Day. This historical genealogy indelibly shapes today\u2019s movement. Latin American activists tend to frame the right to abortion as a human right and an essential aspect of full citizenship. They highlight the connections that restrictions on reproductive freedom have to inequalities across class, race, and sexuality. And they link the issue to other forms of oppression, including domestic and gender- and sexuality-based violence, femicide, and harassment. Their calls for abortion rights are therefore often tied to other social justice causes. In Argentina, for example, activists demanded that abortion be not only legal and safe but also free, recognizing the disproportionate impact of abortion restrictions on the poor. Their demands were met: the law passed in 2020 legalizing abortion makes the procedure free of charge. It also protects the right to access contraception and sex education as part of a comprehensive approach to sexual and reproductive health. And it recognizes the right to access care by \u201cwomen and persons with other gender identities with the capacity to gestate,\u201d including transgender men and queer and nonbinary people, partly in recognition of the  central roles  that  LGBTQ  people and transgender activists played in the abortion rights movement. The broad framing of abortion rights helped to galvanize a mass movement. Organizing for reproductive rights in Argentina began with a few persistent activists; today, some 700 groups belong to the National Campaign for the Right to Legal, Safe, and Free Abortion, formed in 2005. This diverse, multigenerational grassroots coalition includes feminist and women\u2019s organizations as well as human rights groups, high school and college student organizations, trade unions, academic institutions, political parties, and religious communities. The campaign\u2019s chief strategy was to repeatedly introduce bills legalizing abortion. In 2018, a million people marched in the streets of Buenos Aires to exert pressure when, for the first time, legislators took up an abortion bill for debate. Although the law did not pass, the protests showed that opposition to abortion had become a political liability. And in another first, candidates in the 2019 presidential election were forced to take a position on the issue.\u00a0 During the first year of the  COVID-19  pandemic, with recently elected Argentine President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez openly in favor of legalization, the movement continued to exert pressure though mass media, social media, political lobbying, and street mobilization. Finally, in December 2020, the Argentine Senate voted to legalize abortion until the 14th week of pregnancy.\u00a0 Highlighting the unequal burden of criminalization proved a powerful political strategy in Colombia, too. A movement called Causa Justa\u2014a coalition of women\u2019s groups, feminist organizations, health-care providers, and researchers\u2014pursued social change through the courts. In 2022, the strategy paid off. Colombia\u2019s constitutional court, ruling on a case Causa Justa had filed, decriminalized abortion. Its  decision  underscored the fact that women who are particularly vulnerable\u2014on account of their status as a migrant, for example\u2014are also those most likely to be prosecuted for abortion and to face the worst health outcomes from unsafe procedures. In other words, in the court\u2019s view, the inequitable consequences of abortion restrictions constituted a reason to abolish them. Since 2015, a broad political coalition for abortion rights has also emerged in Chile, with the Mesa Acci\u00f3n por el Aborto en Chile, a coalition of women\u2019s, feminist, and human rights groups. Feminists were at the center of the  estallido social  (social outburst), a series of massive protests that took place across the country beginning in October 2019. After months of social unrest, the demonstrations led to dramatic institutional change. Chileans voted overwhelmingly for a new constitution\u2014and for the convention charged with its rewriting to include equal numbers of male and female delegates. According to one  study , 57 percent of the 155 delegates elected to the constitutional convention articulated one or more positions that the investigators identified as \u201cfeminist.\u201d Eventually, delegates produced a draft constitution that includes a clause guaranteeing that the state will provide \u201cthe conditions for pregnancy, voluntary interruption of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood to be voluntary and protected.\u201d Chileans will vote on the new constitution in September. Protesting in Seattle, Washington, May 2022   Lindsey Wasson / Reuters   These political successes have been decades in the making, and one country\u2019s step forward energizes activists across the region. But Latin American feminists have not been focused exclusively on legal change. Another crucial aspect of grassroots activism in recent years is the development of networks of  acompa\u00f1antes  (companions). Operating in at least 15 countries,  acompa\u00f1antes  assist women with self-managed abortions using misoprostol, a drug that was originally prescribed to treat ulcers but can also be used to terminate a pregnancy. The  acompa\u00f1antes  provide information and emotional support throughout the process.\u00a0 In the short run, accompaniment networks have expanded access to safe abortion in countries where the procedure is illegal. (The World Health Organization has declared self-managed, medication-based abortions to be both safe and effective.) In the longer run, accompaniment has also proved a powerful political strategy. The networks help destigmatize abortion by transforming the procedure from a secret, solitary, and shameful act to an experience that women encounter in solidarity with one another. Indeed, reproductive rights activism in Latin America has long pursued not just legal decriminalization but also social decriminalization\u2014shaping cultural understandings in an effort to normalize abortion.\u00a0 In Mexico, as in Argentina and Colombia,  acompa\u00f1antes  have continued their work even after the decriminalization of abortion. Women often prefer the autonomy of self-managed abortions and the empathetic care of the  acompa\u00f1antes  over alienating encounters with medical systems. Many activists also see the networks as a hedge against the possibility that future governments could restrict access to abortion\u2014removing funding, for example\u2014even if they do not directly challenge the law.\u00a0 The abortion rights movement in the United States differs from its Latin American counterparts in significant ways. Mainstream U.S. pro-choice groups frame abortion in relatively narrow terms: politically, in terms of the individual\u2019s right to bodily autonomy and choice, and legally, in terms of the individual right to privacy. At key moments, legality for the privileged has taken precedence over accessibility for all. Just three years after  Roe v. Wade , Congress passed the Hyde Amendment, banning federal Medicaid funding of abortions. For many low-income women\u2014who are also disproportionately women of color\u2014the law effectively blocked access to the constitutional right to an abortion. Activists failed to mobilize successfully against the law or the avalanche of additional restrictions that followed. But outside the mainstream U.S. pro-choice movement are groups that more closely resemble the activism that exists elsewhere in the hemisphere. In 1994, an organization of Black women called Women of African Descent for Reproductive Justice coined the term \u201creproductive justice,\u201d which couches abortion within the frameworks of social justice and human rights. Reproductive justice is defined as \u201cthe human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities\u201d\u2014a definition that emphasizes access, not just choice, and frames the fight for legal abortion as part of a much bigger struggle for reproductive autonomy, access, and well-being, especially for poor women and women of color. This is a strategy that opens the door for cooperation among organizations working across a broad array of social and economic issues. In a post- Roe  United States, activists will need to build the kind of robust foundation for abortion rights that made it possible for their Latin American peers to secure political change. They must mobilize different social movements and organizations. And they must strengthen alliances across borders. Regional solidarity seemed moot for the past half century, when the United States alone enshrined abortion rights in a hemisphere of criminalization. But now international cooperation may prove crucial to abortion access. Mexican  acompa\u00f1antes  have already begun organizing to bring women seeking abortions in the United States south to Mexico\u2014and to distribute advice and pills northward. Latin American activists can provide their U.S. counterparts with a sobering perspective born of struggle. During decades of criminalization, they painstakingly worked to destigmatize abortion and to gather support for their campaigns, aware that it could take years to secure legal victory. But the bleak political landscape also led to innovation. The expansion of safe abortion access through  acompa\u00f1antes  emerged in part because the paths to reform seemed closed. \u00a0 Meanwhile, historical experiences of murderous authoritarianism drove home the difficult lesson that rights once given can also be taken away. As is now painfully obvious for supporters of abortion rights in the United States, a belief in their country as a beacon of democracy and progress created a dangerous complacency. To prevent the demise of  Roe  from becoming a permanent defeat, they must look abroad for inspiration about how to win back rights that many in the United States had come to take for granted.

In 1994, an organization of Black women called Women of African Descent for Reproductive Justice coined the term \u201creproductive justice,\u201d which couches abortion within the frameworks of social justice and human rights. Reproductive justice is defined as \u201cthe human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children, not have children, and parent the children we have in safe and sustainable communities\u201d\u2014a definition that emphasizes access, not just choice, and frames the fight for legal abortion as part of a much bigger struggle for reproductive autonomy, access, and well-being, especially for poor women and women of color. This is a strategy that opens the door for cooperation among organizations working across a broad array of social and economic issues.@@In a post-@@ United States, activists will need to build the kind of robust foundation for abortion rights that made it possible for their Latin American peers to secure political change. They must mobilize different social movements and organizations. And they must strengthen alliances across borders. Regional solidarity seemed moot for the past half century, when the United States alone enshrined abortion rights in a hemisphere of criminalization. But now international cooperation may prove crucial to abortion access. Mexican @@ have already begun organizing to bring women seeking abortions in the United States south to Mexico\u2014and to distribute advice and pills northward.@@Latin American activists can provide their U.S. counterparts with a sobering perspective born of struggle. During decades of criminalization, they painstakingly worked to destigmatize abortion and to gather support for their campaigns, aware that it could take years to secure legal victory. But the bleak political landscape also led to innovation. The expansion of safe abortion access through @@ emerged in part because the paths to reform seemed closed. \u00a0@@Meanwhile, historical experiences of murderous authoritarianism drove home the difficult lesson that rights once given can also be taken away. As is now painfully obvious for supporters of abortion rights in the United States, a belief in their country as a beacon of democracy and progress created a dangerous complacency. To prevent the demise of @@ from becoming a permanent defeat, they must look abroad for inspiration about how to win back rights that many in the United States had come to take for granted.",

Illinois, was horrifying\u2014and all too predictable.  Over the past decade, there have been scores of mass killings across the United States. In 2012, a shooter murdered seven Sikh worshipers in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. In 2015, an assailant massacred nine Black people at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. An attacker killed 23 Walmart shoppers in 2019 in El Paso, Texas. And on May 24 of this year, a shooter killed 21 people in Uvalde, Texas.  These episodes have no single formula, but recent assailants typically share a similar set of toxic traits: a history of murderous fantasies, violent nihilism, self-harm, or suicidal ideation; withdrawal from friends and family; and streaks of cruelty expressed through the torture or killing of animals, the stalking or harassing of women, or threats of rape and other physical harm.  Investigators are still  learning  about the  Highland Park  assailant and his motive, but they know that the 21-year-old alleged shooter had threatened to kill his family and commit suicide. Similarly, the man charged with  murdering ten Black Americans in June 2022 at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, had threatened to commit a murder-suicide and had written about stabbing and beheading a cat.  Many attackers, including the one in Buffalo, are domestic terrorists who specifically aim to kill minorities. But whether the assailants are ideological or not, they share another common feature: exposure to violent online content. The alleged Highland Park shooter spent time in toxic digital forums that glorified massacres,  and he repeatedly posted violent imagery and videos online, including content suggesting he had \u201ca plan and a desire to commit carnage . \u201d  The alleged Buffalo assailant was radicalized by white supremacist content he discovered on the Internet during the pandemic while he was, as he put it, \u201cbored.\u201d He was especially taken by material that promoted a conspiracy theory known as the \u201cgreat replacement,\u201d which falsely describes an orchestrated effort by Jews or Muslims to replace white, Christian civilization through immigration and demographic changes. Other recent acts of terrorism against Jews, Muslims, Latinos, and now Black people have also been motivated by this conspiracy theory. These attacks are then celebrated in online  white supremacist  communities as heroic acts of martyrdom, fueling more violence. My research lab has listed talk of the great replacement theory as the first warning sign for parents and caregivers that their children are being radicalized. At this point, government officials, bystanders, and private companies have worked to find potential assailants based on the threatening online content they post and consume. But better reporting and response tools are Band-Aid solutions aimed at intervening in cases already egregious enough to warrant assessment. To truly prevent domestic terrorism and mass attacks, U.S. policymakers must focus not just on stopping dangerous individuals but on counteracting the online worlds they inhabit. Instead of concentrating its response at the end point of  radicalization \u2014the time right before an attack\u2014the government should work to stop individuals from engaging with online hate and harm to begin with.  HATE HAS A HOME In the digital world, hate is commonplace. People see violent material and  disinformation  not just on sketchy Web forums but on popular platforms such as TikTok, Roblox, Steam, Twitch, DLive, and Discord. (The latter four platforms are widely used by online gamers.) These places also serve as conduits for harassment. Users of Discord, for instance, are known to engage in \u201craiding,\u201d in which members of marginalized groups are spammed with hostile content. Such harassment further compounds hatred. Research shows that people who engage in harmful online behavior such as trolling, harassment, or doxxing are more likely to be persuaded by white supremacist views. They may then join the ranks of the millions of white, overwhelmingly male Americans who lurk on  supremacist  platforms: websites that degrade marginalized groups and promote violence. Some of these sites refer to successful terrorist actors as \u201csaints\u201d and potential emulators as \u201cdisciples.\u201d They can feature memes with scoreboard-style \u201ckill counts.\u201d Although it is tempting to view these forums as\u2014almost exclusively\u2014places where the already extreme mingle, plot, and grow more radicalized, people who do not espouse violence also sometimes find themselves on platforms that traffic in dehumanizing content. They, too, can then become desensitized to the material. Some will follow hyperlink after hyperlink into an ever-deeper rabbit hole of us-versus-them thinking that calls for violence.   Some white supremacist sites refer to successful terrorist actors as \u201csaints.\u201d At their most extreme, these sites feature  posters who vie to upload increasingly  violent and offensive imagery\u2014including child pornography and images of torture or mass harm\u2014to prove their resolve. But dangerous content doesn\u2019t need to be explicit. The Internet is awash in material that glorifies violence by embedding it in coded speech, memes, and cartoons that use satire and irony to maintain plausible deniability, allowing peddlers to brush off critics as \u201csnowflakes\u201d who can\u2019t take a joke.  Young people are especially vulnerable to this kind of programming. American teenagers spend more than half their waking hours online\u2014averaging nine hours per day of screen time\u2014and 64  percent  of them report encountering hateful content on social media. Adults, who spend less time online, often fail to recognize just how widespread and normalized online toxicity is. Young people, meanwhile, often regard it as normal. Before he killed 19 students and two teachers at an elementary school in Uvalde, the alleged assailant regularly threatened teen girls online with kidnapping, rape, and murder. He spent time in toxic online subcultures where he posted images of dead cats, and he threatened to shoot his grandmother and children at school. Although plenty of youth observed the alleged shooter\u2019s digital rage, many dismissed it as simply a product of, as one teenager put it, \u201cwhat online is.\u201d One teen did  report  the alleged assailant to the social media app Yubo, but he said that the app failed to respond.  Unfortunately, the United States doesn\u2019t do much better at monitoring and catching dangerous offline behavior. The alleged Buffalo shooter was referred for a psychiatric evaluation after telling his high school classmates he wanted to carry out mass violence, but he was released. When he graduated from high school two weeks later, investigators stopped paying attention to his case. Within a year, he had targeted and murdered Black Americans. EXTREMIST IMMUNITY U.S. policymakers are aware that existing approaches have not succeeded in stopping domestic  extremism , and they are working to catch up. In June 2021, the Biden administration issued the country\u2019s first-ever national strategy for countering domestic terrorism. The Department of Homeland Security reorganized its terrorism prevention efforts, including by launching regional offices across the country. And within a week of the Buffalo shooting, New York Governor Kathy Hochul ordered a comprehensive review of the state\u2019s procedures for addressing violent extremism and laid out a pathway for reform. (Many policymakers have also proposed stricter gun laws, which have almost eliminated mass shootings in Australia and the United Kingdom, but these effective measures have virtually no chance of being enacted in the United States.) The scramble to better respond to domestic extremism has resulted in useful new initiatives and tools. The U.S. government and its state and local counterparts have better reporting systems than they did just a few years ago. They also have new law enforcement training on how to recognize warning signs, as well as bystander intervention and crisis training that can reduce the lethality of violent attacks. Hochul has established a state-level unit dedicated to stopping domestic terrorism. Yet these measures, although all important, are incomplete. To truly curb terrorism and other episodes of mass violence, policymakers need to tackle hateful digital content itself.  This might seem like a tall order, given the United States\u2019 strong  free speech  protections. But limiting the reach of extremist content doesn\u2019t require censorship. Decades of public health research shows that people can develop resistance to even subtle attempts at persuasion through what is called \u201cattitudinal inoculation,\u201d which helps people build mental resistance to dangerous messaging by showing them  a  small amount of harmful content along with an explanation of how it seeks to influence their views. Attitudinal inoculation works because people don\u2019t like to find out they are being manipulated. As a result, when individuals learn that someone is trying to sway them, they typically reject that person\u2019s advances. Over the past two years, my research lab has found that this approach can be successfully applied to online disinformation. In partnership with Jigsaw, a unit of Google focused on improving Internet safety, our team showed participants online videos that prebunk ed  various conspiracy theories and propaganda. In our study, the participants who watched an inoculation video about white supremacist propaganda were significantly less likely to support the messaging than were the noninoculated participants. Watchers also found the source of the propaganda less credible, and they were less willing to offer financial, ideological, or logistical support to violent extremists. Similarly, people who watched inoculation videos about anti-vaccine propaganda were less likely to support sharing vaccine misinformation and disinformation than were the control groups. They were also more willing to get a COVID-19 shot. This process may seem time consuming, but it isn\u2019t. Our studies show that inoculation videos as short as 30 seconds\u2014the length of a commercial advertisement\u2014are effective at countering online propaganda.  TEACHING TOLERANCE Yet as useful as it is, attitudinal inoculation cannot by itself stop radicalization. It is still not clear, for example, how long the resistance it confers lasts or whether inoculation against one form of propaganda might confer some resistance against another. Inoculation, then, is just one part of what needs to be a comprehensive effort to address online harms. States must also work to stop violent racism and misogyny from being normalized by teaching about it and other forms of exclusion and inequality so that people know to challenge dehumanizing content or jokes before they encounter them. When children with questions about race and gender do not have trusted sources of information, they are more vulnerable to false explanations offered by conspiracy theories and online propaganda.  To teach about issues surrounding race and gender, schools will need to actively educate students about the roots of hatred and discrimination whenever they can. This won\u2019t be easy, given that teaching about racism has become deeply politicized. But there are  ways  to teach about hate and discrimination that can get around very troubling government efforts to banish race from classroom discussions. A group of college students in my lab, for example, recently won a Department of Homeland Security college competition aimed at stopping attacks by making an animated video about misinformation, paired with lesson plans for elementary school students. The video takes place in an elementary school full of anthropomorphized animals, and it shares the story of a new student, a duck named Daniel, who is excluded by the other animals because they encountered online misinformation about ducks being dumb. By not using humans, it teaches children to empathize with those who are different from them while not reinforcing harmful stereotypes. Policymakers looking to prevent violent extremism and mass shootings should also expand their educational efforts in other ways. They need revamped  public  civic education that can strengthen commitments to inclusive  democracy . They must work in collaboration with health and human services, the arts community, local parenting groups, and other organizations to cut back on public displays of hate. Communities need support to better recognize early warning signs and red flags of possible radicalization or violent mobilization, but they also need to know where to go to get more help or treatment options when they do see red flags\u2014just as they would know how to do for any other problem, from eating disorders to sexual assault or addiction.  Governments, businesses, and communities should also, of course, look for ways to prohibit the spread of hateful online content itself. Social media companies have a particular responsibility to block radicalizing information. But Americans are fooling themselves if they think the country can ban or arrest its way out of violence. It is impossible to filter out all of the world\u2019s harmful online content, and intelligence authorities and first responders can\u2019t thwart every violent attack. It is time, then, for communities to systematically equip people with the tools they need to recognize and reject propaganda and disinformation, be it through attitudinal inoculation or work with parents, teachers, mental health counselors, coaches, and anyone else in a leadership position. Otherwise, domestic violent extremism will continue to fester and metastasize, putting more lives at risk. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

COVID-19 recession, coming on top of the financial crisis of 2008, would lead rich democracies to redefine the outer limits of their monetary and fiscal power, ushering in an \u201cage of magic money.\u201d Because central banks had a long record of containing inflation, the penalty for profligacy would likely not materialize; supersized stimuli could coexist with stable prices. Of course, the success of this experiment would depend on the continued inflation-fighting credibility of central banks, the Federal Reserve foremost among them. \u201c If the Fed loses its independence, the age of magic money could end in catastrophe,\u201d I noted. Si nce then, the idea of magic money has been discredited. Although the Federal Reserve has yet to lose its independence, it has fumbled the inflation challenge in ways that I failed to take sufficiently seriously. For the first time in about two decades, the imperative of price stability will complicate central banks\u2019 ability to achieve other objectives, from financial stability (it will be hard to cut interest rates to help weak borrowers) to employment stability (as it plays catch-up against inflation, the Fed will probably cause a recession). A few years ago, cartoonists regularly portrayed central bankers in Superman outfits. Now that inflation has returned, the monetary superheroes have lost their powers. How long this fall to earth will endure depends on two questions. First, was the whole idea of magic money doomed from the get-go, or could it have succeeded if managed differently? Second, if some other approach could have worked, can the Fed learn lessons from its experience?  The Road Taken Start with the first question, which is the more straightforward. Under the right conditions, magic money can undoubtedly be deployed successfully.  Both theory and experience teach that large economic stimuli\u2014delivered by central bankers or budget authorities or both\u2014need not destabilize prices. If a financial crash or a  pandemic  causes private spending to collapse, governments can print money and run budget deficits to push spending up again. If this intervention is well calibrated, demand will remain in balance with supply, causing no change in inflation. To be sure, the calibration is difficult, not least because government largess puts money into the hands of private companies and households, whose eagerness to spend is uncertain. But stimulus at least has a shot at balancing supply and demand. In contrast, not stimulating guarantees that demand will be too low, ushering in deflation and recession.  The idea of magic money has been discredited. The government\u2019s response to the 2008 financial crisis provides an illustration of this process. Central banks printed trillions of dollars, leading their critics to predict terrible inflation. But in the 36 quarters from 2009 to 2017, core inflation  never exceeded  the Fed\u2019s two percent target, averaging only 1.5 percent. Far from being reckless, this first experiment with magic money was actually too timid: given the inflation undershoot, an even larger stimulus would have been appropriate. Even so, the stimulus was a success. It saved the U.S. economy from a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s.  At first, the response to COVID-19 was even more impressive. The pandemic caused U.S. GDP to collapse in the second quarter of 2020: output shrank at an annualized rate of 32 percent.  This fall was four times deeper than the hit from the financial crisis in the fourth quarter of 2008; indeed, it was the sharpest ever contraction in the post\u2013World War II period. The Fed responded aggressively, creating  twice  as much money as it had from 2008 to 2009. Likewise, the president and Congress delivered a budget stimulus that was  twice  as big as the 2009 version. By acting so vigorously, authorities demonstrated that they had learned the lesson of the last recession, when they undershot with their spending. They were also emboldened by the fact that inflation expectations were  low , reducing the risk that a stimulus would set off an upward price spiral. In the second half of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, this mega-stimulus worked perfectly. The U.S. economy bounced back, almost  recovering  its pre-pandemic level of output. And despite the lavish money-printing, there was no sign of inflation. In the first quarter of 2021, the Fed\u2019s preferred index of \u201ccore\u201d prices was up just  1.7 percent  from the previous year. As of March, the broader consumer price index remained well within the  comfort zone .  If the authorities had been able to stop there, they would have pulled off a textbook example of macroeconomic stabilization. But from the spring of 2021 the experiment started to go wrong. How it failed provides lessons for policymakers attempting to navigate the current macroeconomic moment. Don\u2019t Blame the Bully Pulpit When I proposed the idea of magic money back in 2020, the likeliest source of economic misjudgment appeared to reside in the White House. U.S. President Donald Trump had scant respect for the independence of the central bank, tweeting about it on more than  100 occasions . \u201cMy only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?\u201d he  fulminated  in the summer of 2019, at a time when Fed Chair Jerome Powell was hiking interest rates more than Trump found congenial. The closest historical precedent for this bullying illustrated how serious the consequences could be. In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon slandered Fed Chair Arthur Burns. The browbeating contributed to the chronically timid monetary policy of that decade, and hence to stagflation.  Given this experience, Trump\u2019s intemperate Fed commentary seemed to present the chief risk of magic money. It was easy to imagine a situation in which, because of the difficulty of calibrating the stimulus, there might be an initial spurt of inflation. Once that happened, the Fed might flinch from clamping down, allowing inflation to persist out of fear of pressure from the White House.   Presidential bullying is not the only reason central banks lose their grip on inflation. The 2020 election changed this calculus. Unlike his predecessor, President  Joe Biden  showed no inclination to browbeat the Fed, on Twitter or elsewhere. His Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, was herself a former Fed chair, and would therefore be the last person to attack the institution. In May 2022, with the inflation  threat intensifying, Biden went out of his way to emphasize the independence of the central bank. \u201c My predecessor demeaned the Fed, and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation,\u201d he  wrote  in  The   Wall Street Journal . \u201cI won\u2019t do this,\u201d he added.  But it turns out that presidential bullying is not the only reason why central banks lose their grip on inflation. Starting in the spring and summer of 2021, the Fed committed three mistakes, opening the door to today\u2019s price surge. Regrettably, very few observers, and certainly not this one, anticipated all three. But the good news is that two of these errors point to ways in which the Fed can reform its approach in the future, perhaps allowing an eventual return to the use of magic money. Not a Passing Phase The Fed\u2019s first error has received by far the most attention, but it is also the hardest to learn from. It consisted in miscalibrating the balance between supply and demand, a challenge that, as noted already, is necessarily hard, given the unpredictable spending decisions of private citizens and companies.  The miscalibration began with the passage of the American Rescue Plan in March 2021. This was the third budgetary stimulus delivered by the U.S. Congress, and it crossed the line from appropriate support to dubious overreach. In March and April 2020, Washington had enacted a fiscal stimulus worth  $2.4 trillion ; in December it had followed up with a further $900 billion. With this extra spending in the pipeline, the U.S. economy was  expected to grow by four percent between the fourth quarter of 2020 and the fourth quarter of 2021, a respectable performance. The March 2021 stimulus sloshed an extra $1.9 trillion of fuel onto the fire. Commenting on the likely upshot before the passage of the bill, the Brookings Institution forecast \u00a0that by the end of 2021 the economy would be \u201coperating above its maximum sustainable level.\u201d Confronted with this risk of inflationary overshoot, the Fed declined to raise interest rates or dial back its quantitative easing\u2014the bond-buying program by which it affects longer-term interest rates. To some Fed critics, this was a clear error. If the central bankers had listened to forecasters such as the Brookings team, they would have headed off today\u2019s inflation. But the truth is that forecasting in the midst of the pandemic was more art than science, and the Fed\u2019s wait-and-see attitude was arguably understandable. Although the $1.9 trillion stimulus presented an obvious risk of overreach, it remained possible that other forces would conspire to dampen demand. To cite just one wild card, the contagious Delta variant of COVID-19 spread rapidly in the summer of 2021, leading to a  surge  in the total infection rate in August and September.  As the Fed sat on the sidelines, core inflation drifted up, reaching an annual rate of  3.4 percent  by the second quarter of 2021 and 3.6 percent in the third quarter. Again, with the benefit of hindsight, the Fed should have hiked interest rates, snuffing out the inflation before it became serious. But the Fed justified procrastination by arguing that the inflation was merely \u201ctransitory.\u201d COVID-19-related supply-chain snafus seemed to explain the upward pressure on prices; as workers returned to jobs and ports reopened, these bottlenecks would surely correct themselves. And to be fair to the central bankers, respected private economists shared this optimistic view. As late as November, the economics team at Goldman Sachs opined that \u201cunderlying supply-demand imbalances will \u2026 largely work themselves out, leaving inflation near the Fed\u2019s goal.\u201d That same month, Nobel Prize laureate Paul Krugman  ascribed  the inflation to supply-chain bottlenecks and called it \u201can excusable and manageable problem.\u201d  Those who correctly predicted the price surge are entitled to their victory lap. Of course, in retrospect, Team Transitory was wrong, and I  shared  in this error. Those who correctly predicted the price surge are entitled to their victory lap. If there\u2019s a lesson from this episode, it\u2019s that stimulus is inflationary when an economic shock damages supply more than demand: in hindsight, the striking fact about the emergence from the pandemic is that people resumed spending faster than they resumed work. But the larger point is that responding to an unprecedented health crisis combined with a record GDP shock is inescapably hard, and the familiar insight that supply shocks are different from demand shocks won\u2019t make the response easier. The Fed already retains an economics faculty nearly eight times larger than Harvard University\u2019s; if it had been obvious that people were going to return to work slowly, constraining supply, the central bankers would have tightened earlier. Telling the Fed to distinguish supply shocks from demand shocks is like instructing a sprinter to run fast. The advice is so obvious as to be useless.  Whatever the merits of the \u201ctransitory\u201d debate, by the end of November 2021 it was over. Core inflation came in at  4.2 percent  for the year to October, a marked acceleration since the summer. On November 30, Powell  testified  to Congress that it was time to retire the T word. But then the Fed committed its second error. Rather than admitting its misjudgment and raising interest rates quickly, it waited more than three months to do so. When the hike finally came, in March 2022, it was the smallest it could be: 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percentage point. This was all the more remarkable because by the time of the March meeting the case for stronger medicine was clear: core inflation had climbed steadily, to 5.3 percent over the year through February, and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on February 24 was set to boost the cost of food and energy. Yet it was not until the Fed\u2019s June meeting that it finally got serious, delivering a 75-basis-point hike. By then, more than six months had elapsed since Powell had given up on \u201ctransitory.\u201d Unlike the Fed\u2019s wait-and-see approach in 2021, the excruciatingly slow course correction in the first half of 2022 was inexcusable. Faced with a negative shock to the economy, the Fed has always been quick to provide stimulus. But when it came to fighting inflation, it refused to provide the bitter medicine of rate hikes with anything like the same urgency. Why was the Fed so languid? The reason lay in its misguided attachment to \u201cforward guidance,\u201d the practice of signaling interest-rate moves well ahead of implementing them. This speak-wait-act triple jump is useful when inflation is too low and the Fed, having already slashed the short-term interest rate to zero, has no room to cut further. In such circumstances, when policy has hit what central bankers call the zero lower bound, forward guidance allows the Fed to promise an extended period of rock-bottom short-term interest rates. A long period of guaranteed low short rates makes for lower long-term rates. Forward guidance thus becomes an additional way to provide stimulus to the economy.  This logic ceases to matter when the Fed faces the opposite challenge of high inflation. To bring inflation down, the Fed can raise the short-term interest rate as much as it likes: there is no upper bound, and therefore no pressing need for forward guidance. But in the wake of its admission that inflation was non-transitory, the Fed stuck to forward guidance anyway, floating the idea of raising rates, then waiting, then acting. The best rationalization of this behavior is that the Fed feared that a sudden rate hike would upset investors and cause a panicky market fall. But this concern is overblown. When the goal is to cool the economy and get inflation down, a market decline is desirable. In short, the Fed\u2019s fondness for forward guidance needs rethinking. By refusing to hike interest rates promptly, and by waiting half a year before delivering a 75-basis-point rise, the Fed allowed bad inflation to get worse, an error for which the economy will now pay dearly. But the good news is that the lesson from this mistake is straightforward. Sometimes the Fed should act without guiding the markets. Sometimes speed is the priority.  Pay Attention to Markets The Fed\u2019s last error was to ignore the financial bubble that inflated during 2021, signaling that trouble was brewing. As with the excessive fealty to forward guidance, the policy of ignoring the bubble reflected a deeply ingrained reflex among central bankers. Its origin dates back to 1996, when Fed Chair Alan Greenspan gingerly questioned Wall Street\u2019s \u201cirrational exuberance.\u201d Stock prices proceeded to boom over the next year, and the Fed\u2019s leaders concluded that commenting on markets was a fool\u2019s errand. The best policy, they decided, was to keep quiet about booms, then cut interest rates after the busts to cushion the economy.  Calling market tops is hard, and the Fed\u2019s caution is understandable. Given that central banks have one main policy instrument\u2014the interest rate\u2014they can\u2019t respond to two separate signals if these point in different ways: if, for example, the economy looks weak while the stock market looks bubbly. But the Fed\u2019s see-no-evil stance on bubbles has been taken too far. The last two recessions before the 2020 COVID-19 shock followed traumatic market corrections\u2014the dot-com bust of 2000-2001 and the mortgage collapse of 2007-8. In modern financialized economies, asset prices are simply too important to ignore. They are both a signal of pressures to which the Fed ought to respond and a warning of disruption if the Fed does nothing.  In debates about this issue over the past twenty years, the see-no-evil camp has pointed to cases in which a central bank has raised interest rates to prick a bubble, only to reverse course when the hike harms the real economy. But this is a straw man. Nobody is suggesting that central bankers should tighten when unemployment is elevated, inflation is substantially below target, or growth is below trend: of course the real economy must be the priority. But sometimes the Fed confronts circumstances in which real-economy indicators are solid while financial ones look positively exuberant. Under these conditions, bubbly asset prices are a signal that the Fed should tighten more than if it were simply targeting inflation. Past examples include late 1998 and early 1999, when the Fed allowed the dot-com mania to run wild; and 2004\u20135, when it ignored the  mortgage bubble .   When asset prices shoot up, pay attention. In mid-2021, a policy of leaning against the financial winds would also have served the Fed well. On July 1, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index closed at  14,522 , a scary 48 percent above its peak on the eve of the pandemic. Meanwhile real estate was frothy, cryptocurrencies were booming, and celebrities were forming Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs)\u2014mechanisms for taking companies public while avoiding proper scrutiny. Even if the Fed thought that the incipient inflation was transitory, asset prices were screaming that the economy was running hot. Too much money was chasing too few savings instruments. If the Fed had factored financial signals into its decisions, it would have tightened earlier, and the economy might have been spared the 2022 inflation.  Hence the second clear lesson for future leaders of the Fed. When asset prices shoot up, pay attention. Depending on what is happening with the real economy, this could well be a signal to raise interest rates.  Lessons Learned Where does all this leave magic money? For the foreseeable future, it is off the table. The priority must be to control inflation, a necessary condition for upholding the credibility of the Fed, without which economic stability is impossible. Unfortunately, this struggle against inflation may take time. The three decades of low inflation and low interest rates running from roughly 1992 to 2022 were partly the result of globalization, which exerted a downward pressure on prices. Today, globalization has  stalled , and the new vogue for stockpiling strategic commodities and \u201cfriend-shoring\u201d supplies will be inflationary. Add in the aging of populations and the possibility that young workers will insist on a flexible approach to work, and the Fed may have to run tighter policy than in the past quarter of a century. The expectation that took hold in the late 1990s, that the Fed could be relied upon to cushion the economy from almost any type of shock, may have to be revised. The next few years could be bruising.  But, just as the stagflationary 1970s gave way to the stability and prosperity of later years, so the cycle will turn again. The Fed will get inflation under control, and central banks will once again work magic. Over the long sweep of post\u2013World War II history, the art and science of central banking has advanced steadily, with each decade of experience building on the previous ones. Sometimes the most humiliating setbacks teach the most valuable lessons. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

LinkedIn Get a link Request Reprint Permissions Democrats and Republicans alike have greeted the prospect of a long-term rivalry with China as a challenge that will bring out the best of the United States. For years, Washington has touted China as the U.S. military\u2019s  only worthy adversary  and the kind of threat that could mobilize the national will and cure what\u2019s ailing American democracy.  Russia\u2019s catastrophic  invasion  of Ukraine has only hardened this conventional wisdom. Even though its origins have nothing to do with China, the war has encouraged Washington to see these two great powers as being of a kind. Just as competition with China is supposed to be the path to American renewal, so, too, is the ongoing struggle against Russia considered a  \u201cgood war\u201d  that can salvage the Cold War \u2013 era faith in waging winnable battles against autocrats. Ukraine reminds the world of the inherent virtues of democracy and of the possibility of the bipartisanship that supposedly governed world affairs after the Cold War. As the scholar  Francis Fukuyama  wrote in March, \u201cThe  spirit of 1989  went to sleep, and now it\u2019s being reawakened.\u201d  But reconfiguring Western foreign policy for great-power conflict will not help restore democracy in the United States or anywhere else. There is little evidence that great-power competition strengthens civic bonds, equal rights, or economic security and much to suggest it could turn democracy further against itself. In fact, if the United States wants a well-functioning polity with a civil society at peace, the last thing it should seek is great-power rivalry. Many of the most pressing threats to democracy cannot be solved through a competitive framework: climate change, white nationalism and xenophobia, pandemics, and economic inequality. Instead of betting that conflict with China and Russia will invigorate the West, the United States and its partners should promote institutions of regional and global governance to mitigate the damage to democracy that great-power competition will invariably inflict. ROMANTICIZING THE COLD WAR The preoccupation with great-power competition is problematic not only because it is not a  strategy  but also because it substitutes a slogan\u2014or more specifically a zero-sum competitive impulse\u2014for a strategic purpose. It elides even the possibility for a more  democratic grand strategy , one that can empower all citizens, reflect majoritarian consensus, and project democratic aspirations at home and abroad. The United States needs a foreign policy that works for all Americans, not just one for corporations or even the  middle class.   The Washington establishment\u2019s view that great-power conflict is a net good for the United States derives from a tortured reading of Cold War history. In this view, Soviet rivalry provoked the passage of civil rights legislation, the space race led to innovations in technology and computerization, and the Cold War economy created affluence and enabled homeownership for many Americans. This historical interpretation of the Cold War lies behind recent legislation, including the 2021  Strategic Competition Act  and the 2022  America COMPETES  Act, both of which seek to marshal federal resources to spur economic development and job creation, all in an effort to compete with China.  But the Cold War\u2019s influence is much more complicated\u2014and grimmer\u2014than policymakers\u2019 standard telling of it. It is true that the  Cold War  created tremendous economic growth and prosperity, but it did so with deleterious effects on free speech, racial and economic equality, and democratic pluralism. Rivalry with the Soviet Union stoked the  Red Scare \u00a0in the 1950s, during which people merely accused of insufficient loyalty to the U.S. government lost their jobs and were blacklisted in Washington and in Hollywood. It inhibited the most ambitious parts of the civil rights agenda, sacrificing  job creation  and   infrastructure  investment   for Black American communities  in order to pay for the Vietnam War. It delayed needed reforms on  gender by pressing women into domestic familial support roles and  suppressing the feminist movement  until it found a voice alongside other struggles for justice during the Vietnam War era.  And by attacking programs for  full employment ,  national health care,  and labor unionism as \u201csocialist\u201d or \u201ccommunist,\u201d it embrittled the  New Deal economic order  established under U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt.  Great-power rivalry with the Soviets exacerbated class inequalities that paved the way for the  ascendance of austerity politics  in the 1980s. Then, neoliberal prescriptions for managing the economy included a weak welfare state, corporate deregulation, and the privatization of public goods and services\u2014all of which yielded growing disparities in wages, incomes, and job prospects between working-class and wealthy Americans. A political economy dependent upon military spending created jobs in the engineering and tech sectors, but that primarily benefited the highly educated and the upper middle class. The rise of the  postindustrial economy  in the 1970s and 1980s meant that Americans outside the fields of technology, academia, and engineering (fields subsidized by Cold War defense spending), and without advanced degrees, had to look for jobs in the service industry, which provides perpetually insecure, low-wage work without much opportunity for social mobility. The Cold War was not a struggle that benefited the  working class . The Cold War also set a precedent regarding federal spending by which guns necessarily came at the expense of butter. Whereas Pentagon spending averaged  7.6 of GDP , education spending took up only   three percent  between 1946 and 1960. At their height in 1982, Social Security benefits comprised close to  5 percent  of GDP. In the forty years prior, benefits averaged less than 3 percent of GDP. (Only healthcare expenditures  rivaled  national defense as a percentage of GDP during the Cold War). The balance of U.S. defense and social priorities have been mismatched since World War II.  Making matters worse, Cold War liberals conditioned domestic investments on great-power rivalry. This meant decoupling the rationale for public goods from a positive vision for society on its own terms and instead tying it to what would most hurt the Soviets. This made it possible to oppose domestic spending with the contorted logic that it was harmful to competition with the Soviets. Even Democrats started adopting this view of the welfare state by the 1970s, effectively abandoning the labor base of the Democratic party in favor of a white-collar, technologically literate constituency that it saw as more capable of outperforming the United States\u2019 geopolitical foe. This bargain, which has left the Democratic party of the 2020s searching for its political soul, worked out far better for right-wing, nationalist politicians who consistently argued that money spent on poverty reduction\u2014at home and abroad\u2014would be better spent on intercontinental ballistic missiles that could carry nuclear warheads, missile defense programs, and a more muscular foreign policy overall. This tendency helped rationalize the shadow of nuclear terror the world is still forced to live under today, but it did little to, say, shore up American democracy or prepare the United States for a global pandemic\u2014to say nothing of lifting up America\u2019s poor. Fighting a monolithic communist enemy abroad also boomeranged in the form of racism and xenophobia against immigrants at home. The  1950 Internal Security Act , which required Communist Party members to register with the federal government, allowed U.S. authorities to deport naturalized immigrants suspected of \u201cdisloyalty.\u201d After the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943, Chinese immigrants during the Cold War were compelled to  \u201cconfess\u201d  their illegal immigration status\u2014even if they had broken no laws when they came to the United States\u2014to earn their citizenship rights. Such policies reflected the anticommunist hysteria of McCarthyism that lasted well into the 1960s. Even when Democrats finally took up the cause of civil rights, as the historian Mary Dudziak has  explained , it was in a stunted, narrow way that had been delayed decades by the earlier destruction of a previously unified P rogressive movement  that was the first organized champion for political and economic equality in America. That coalition was undone by anticommunist liberals\u2014including Democrats and Republicans\u2014whose visions for change were shortened by defining their politics against an enemy rather than for their own theory of democracy. The failure to see the Cold War for what it was has left the United States unprepared to manage the risks that great-power competition poses to democratic society today. The Biden administration thinks this rivalry will benefit the American middle class and the world, yet it is already poisoning U.S. politics, aiding Chinese President Xi Jinping, and accumulating avoidable strategic risks along the way.  RIVALRY AND RACISM Just as racism and ethnically motivated violence was part of the Cold War experience, so too has it become the most visible and immediate price of today\u2019s showdown with China and Russia. In the past few months alone, xenophobic attacks against Russians and Chinese immigrants have escalated in the United States. Incidents of hate crimes toward Asian Americans have increased  339 percent  since 2021, including a mass shooting in Atlanta in March 2021   that killed six Asian American women. Following the Ukraine invasion, Russian businesses in the United States have been boycotted, and Disney paused its new film releases in Russia.  Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell even went so far as to  recommend  \u201ckicking every Russian student out of the United States.\u201d  This is a disturbing echo of Cold War exclusionism.  U.S. President  Joe Biden  has rightly  denounced  acts of overt racism and xenophobia against Russian and Chinese immigrants. But an antiracist, antixenophobic policy is not one that merely denounces racial slurs or bigoted civilizational reasoning; it must also make it harder, not easier, to traffic in racialized sentiment. And on this count, the Biden administration is failing. Every gesture toward  \u201coutcompeting China\u201d  unintentionally buoys  ethnonationalism  at home and abroad. U.S. policymakers need to understand that Xi draws strength from rivalry, as do American far-right extremists, conspiracy theorists, and the demagogic Washington politicians who pander to them.  Republican senators such as Tom Cotton, Ted Cruz, and Josh Hawley straddle the interests of Washington polite society and the far right. How? By invoking hateful rhetoric and promoting policies of racial exclusion that appeal to white supremacists and conspiracy theorists while maintaining a veneer of legitimacy by claiming that they target the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) or \u201cChina\u201d writ large\u2014a vague menacing \u201cother\u201d that ensnares the larger community of Asian Americans. Months into the 2020 pandemic, Cruz  defended  the use of racially coded epithets aimed at China, including \u201ckung flu\u201d and \u201cChinese virus.\u201d Cotton personally trafficked in these yellow-peril dog whistles, and  co-sponsored  legislation that year to ban Chinese students from securing visas to study science, technology, engineering, or math in the United States. And Hawley earned a  Vanity Fair  headline that read \u201cJosh Hawley Proudly Declares Himself Pro Hate Crimes\u201d after casting the sole vote against the uncontroversial COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. Hawley also campaigned for reelection on ads that included  depiction s of Chinese businessmen taking over American farms, creating a racial stigma around who should be allowed to own the most important tangible asset in the U.S. economy.  A vigil in Philadelphia, March 2021\u00a0   Rachel Wisniewski / Reuters   Stoking this rivalry has also allowed conservatives to avoid political accountability, politicizing Chinese villainy rather than answering at the polls for their conduct in office. Shortly after the January 6, 2021  attack  on the U.S. Capitol, for instance, the BBC asked outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo how the event affected America\u2019s global image, to which he  responded ,  \u201cI actually think that question is basically Chinese propaganda.\u201d   The National Republican Senatorial Committee, similarly, instructed conservatives running for office in 2020 to  tell voters, \u201cCoronavirus was a  Chinese hit-and-run  followed by a cover-up that cost thousands of lives\u201d and Democrats are \u201csoft on China\u201d and to \u201cpush for sanctions on China for its role in spreading the  pandemic .\u201d Their explicit aim was to avoid a referendum on Trump-era conservative policies and his mishandling of the U.S. pandemic  response .  Expedient hate-mongering is not confined to the political right. Rather than condemn Republicans\u2019 race-baiting and diversionary politics, many Democrats flirt with that same premise. Tim Ryan, a Democrat running for Senate in Ohio, has been  unapologetic  in his willingness to blame the economic plight of blue-collar workers on a China bogeyman\u2014\u201cChina is winning and workers are losing\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s us versus China,\u201d he  said  in one ad. Democrats have been complicit in creating the economy that has put millions of Americans in a precarious financial position, so small wonder that they, too, would rather blame China for the state of things than reflect on their culpability.  Democrats have also bet that they can win support on infrastructure investment by framing it in terms of strengthening the United States for long-term competition with China. But perversely, Republicans and conservative Democrats have instead countered that competing with  China  may mean not   investing in the United States\u2019 long-term future. Senator  Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, for instance,  rationalized  voting against Build Back Better legislation last year on the grounds that the United States needed the money for military contingencies against China and Russia. Earlier this year, Manchin joined Cotton in  diverting  $4 billion from a climate fund to Pentagon research and development, citing concerns about China. Whatever the merits of  military spending , it is literally coming at the expense of funding for projects that would directly benefit the  American people \u2014just like it did during the Cold War. And that means Democrats using foreign competition as the key to domestic rejuvenation are making a bad bet that misapprehends the realities of American politics. MAKING STRONGMEN STRONGER In China, rivalrous geopolitics is having similar consequences. China\u2019s political economy, and by extension  Xi\u2019s  rule, depends on oligarchs who exploit a weak labor rights regime and extreme worker precariousness, then move their profits offshore into often risky state-directed investments. This process is how China funds the Belt and Road Initiative, which Washington sees as a sign of Beijing\u2019s hegemonic ambitions. In other words, China\u2019s economic influence abroad is built on inequality and repression at home.  Rivalry perpetuates this dynamic. Economic growth, the great legitimizer of  authoritarian  politics, cannot forever proceed in a straight upward line. When growth rates fall, which in relative terms they are now, the ruling regime needs an alternative source of legitimacy. For  Xi , that alternative is ethnonationalism\u2014the glue that holds together political order in a deeply exploitative economic system.  Like its American cousin, Chinese  ethnonationalism  is a problem because it begets belligerence. The CCP\u2019s \u201cWolf Warrior\u201d diplomacy\u2014the aggressive style of diplomacy adopted under Xi\u2019s administration\u2014is less a sign of  insecurity  than it is a symptom of  nationalism  being stoked for deliberately political ends. And ethnonationalism rationalizes the expansive modernization projects of the People\u2019s Liberation Army, just as the same jingoistic, racially tinged sentiments in the United States are used to justify massive Pentagon budgets. Reactionaries in Washington and Beijing are mirror-imaging each other, and benefiting politically from the negative synergy of rivalry.  Recent history has also made it evident that great-power rivalry does not help efforts to weaken autocrats, and may end up doing the opposite. Great-power competition did not produce leaders such as  Vladimir Putin  of Russia,  Rodrigo Duterte  of the Philippines,  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  of Turkey, or  Viktor Orban  of Hungary, but neither can it manage the forces that propelled them to power: ethnonationalism, economic inequality, and democratic backsliding. Rivalry between countries is not a viable framework for democratic improvement within them. Instead, geopolitical competition compels the United States to make undemocratic moral compromises in the name of democracy. In a rush to convince everyone that \u201c America is back \u201d as leader of the \u201c free world ,\u201d the Biden administration has drawn hypocrisy-riddled distinctions between dictatorship and democracy as an ideological basis for great-power rivalry. But it is self-defeating\u2014and logically contradictory\u2014to enlist foreign governments in an anti-China, anti-Russia foreign policy agenda when the same mindset justifies U.S. backing of despotic, demagogic leaders from Turkey to Saudi Arabia to the Philippines and beyond. The United States\u2019 limited political influence could be much better spent. If left as the sole basis for American grand strategy, great-power rivalry will become circular, validating Russia\u2019s and China\u2019s militarist paths and justifying a superpowered U.S. national security bureaucracy primed for perpetual conflict. It will fail to rectify the sources of democratic  weakness , which are rooted in economic precariousness, political corruption, and racism. It will lead to the election of autocratic  leaders , who decry the United States\u2019 domestic failures and link them to a supposedly weak foreign policy.  Given the public\u2019s lingering desire to see the United States invest more at home, the time is right to shift course. Americans are looking for  U.S. foreign policy  to align with democratic expectations and public opinion. A truly great power would do its utmost to tackle the unresolved issues heightened by the pandemic: racial and economic inequality, a public health crisis, and runaway environmental degradation. Geopolitical rivalry will do none of that. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

of American foreign policy and the challenges facing the Biden administration today in regard to Russia, China, the war in Ukraine, and more. This discussion is the first in our centennial event series celebrating the 100th anniversary of\u00a0 Foreign Affairs . Transcript: Speaker: Antony Blinken, U.S. Secretary of State Presider: Daniel Kurtz-Phelan, Editor, Foreign Affairs Time: 1:00 p.m. EDT Date: Wednesday, June 1, 2022 KURTZ-PHELAN: Good afternoon. I\u2019m Dan Kurtz-Phelan. I\u2019m the editor of  Foreign Affairs . Later this year,  Foreign Affairs  will turn a hundred years old, and I\u2019m thrilled to welcome you all to the first in a series of events that we\u2019re doing to celebrate our birthday. And I cannot think of a more fitting kickoff guest than the current secretary of state, Tony Blinken, especially since he is also a  Foreign Affairs  author. Nor can I think of a more interesting time in recent history to be having this conversation or to be in his position. That is underscored by the fact that we have rescheduled this event twice. The first time it was planned was for February 24 th , and we all know what happened that day. The second time the secretary ended up going to Ukraine. So, given the global tumult at the moment, I won\u2019t spend any more time on introduction just so we can be sure that no global crisis pulls the secretary away before we get into the conversation. He\u2019s going to say a few words before we go to questions, first from me, then from  Foreign Affairs  readers and Council members. Mr. Secretary, a huge thank you for doing this, especially at such an intense moment in history. Over to you. BLINKEN: Dan, thank you very much. Thanks for bringing us together for this conversation. Let me thank Sam as well for convening us. And it\u2019s great to be, virtually at least, with everyone at the Council and all the readers of  Foreign Affairs , which I include myself in. In fact, we have one huge problem, which is despite the virtual world that we live in I continue to get  Foreign Affairs  in hardcopy. This presents something of a challenge when it comes to shelf space, because over the many decades that I\u2019ve been a subscriber it builds up. But we\u2019re trying to figure that out. As Dan said, we planned to have this conversation some months ago. And indeed, February 24 th  was the original date, and we all know what happened on that date. And then, as Dan said, the second time we did it I wound up going to Ukraine. So I have to admit to you, when I woke up this morning I was wondering what was actually going to happen\u2014(laughs)\u2014in the intervening hours. So I\u2019m really glad that, thus far at least, nothing has so we can have this conversation today. I want to thank you for bearing with me as we get this\u2014as we got this get-together back on the books, but I\u2019m glad we were finally able to do it. And, in fact, the world has changed quite a bit in the few months that have passed since the original date we planned to get together. So before turning to the conversation with Dan, turning to questions, let me just say a couple of words first. First, I really am delighted to be able to help kick off the hundredth-anniversary celebration for  Foreign Affairs . The ideas, the analysis that I\u2019ve been privileged like so many of you to read and take in over many years in that distinctive blue cover have literally helped generations of scholars, generations of practitioners, leaders, foreign policymakers of one kind or another, citizens wrap their minds around the most complex issues of the day. W.E.B. Du Bois wrote in  Foreign Affairs  about the global consequences of racism and colonialism. George Kennan\u2014need I say more?\u2014if you go back and look at the infamous \"X\" Long Telegram, you will see, remarkably, passages in it that sound like they could have been written today. Foreign Affairs  foresaw a number of the trends that are actually defining our lives today more broadly. We went back and looked at a number of issues over the years. Back in 2005, so some time ago when some of us were still\u2014(laughs)\u2014literally using internet cafes to check our email, this magazine predicted the rise of all kinds of internet-enabled projects. Many of us, I think, may have read that at the time and not been able to foresee what  Foreign Affairs  did. Now we\u2019ve got cars with wi-fi and refrigerators that give us weather reports. Well,  Foreign Affairs  was on it early. Back in May\u2014June of 2001, I was privileged to appear in the pages of  Foreign Affairs . The piece that I wrote then was titled \u201cThe False Crisis Over The Atlantic,\u201d and the case it made was that the interests of Europe and the United States were fundamentally aligned whatever the differences of the day and despite, at that period in time, a lot of fears of us growing apart. So here we are, twenty-one years later; Europe and the United States are standing and acting together in the face of a very real crisis. And I would argue that not just in that crisis, but beyond it we are more aligned than we\u2019ve been in many years. So let me say a few words about Ukraine-Russia, and then we can get to a conversation. The aggression that we\u2019re seeing from Russia has provoked an extraordinary response in Ukrainians, who are fighting valiantly to defend their country, to defend their people, to defend their independence. They are first and foremost responsible for the success they\u2019ve had thus far in repelling the Russian aggression, but it\u2019s also fair to say that the strong support that they\u2019ve received from the United States and from many other countries around the world\u2014security assistance, humanitarian assistance, economic assistance\u2014has also been a difference maker. And we\u2019re doing that, and of course keeping and even building pressure on Russia to end its aggression. Today, as many of you will have seen, President Biden announced a significant new security assistance package for Ukraine to help give the Ukrainians what they need now to deal with the particular nature of the challenge that they face now in southern and eastern Ukraine. And this will enable them to better defend their territory against the Russian onslaught. We\u2019re also continuing to work with partners to try to address the crises that Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine have helped exacerbate or even provoke. Number one on the top of the list is the food-security crisis that we\u2019re seeing around the world. Already preexisting conditions\u2014climate, COVID\u2014and now you add conflict, this has had a profound effect on the ability of a lot of food to get out of what has been a breadbasket for the world, Ukraine, as well as Russia itself for that matter, causing prices to spike in places where food actually is available, causing shortages in places where it is harder to get at. So we\u2019re working very hard on that. I\u2019m happy to come back to that when we\u2014when we have a conversation. But let me just say this. Even as the\u2014(clears throat)\u2014excuse me\u2014brutal fighting continues, we already see that President Putin has failed to achieve his broader strategic objectives. Instead of erasing Ukraine\u2019s independence, he strengthened it. Instead of asserting Russia\u2019s strength, he\u2019s undermined it. Instead of dividing and weakening the international order, he\u2019s actually brought countries closer together to defend it. You all know this very well. This war is not just about Ukraine, even though its principal victims are, of course, Ukrainians. It is an assault, as well, on the fundamental principles of a rules-based international order\u2014a phrase that we throw around a lot, particularly on 68 th  Street, but one that really still has meaning, and we find has meaning for countries around the world. They know that these rules, these norms, these standards, these basic principles that we established many, many years ago to try to preserve peace and security actually have been relatively effective in doing that for all of the challenges we\u2019ve had in matching our ideals to practical realities. And they see these rules as being under assault by Russia in Ukraine as well. Finally, let me just add a word on China and then we\u2019ll have a conversation. Even as we\u2019re doing everything we can to stand up for Ukraine\u2019s security, for its democracy, for its independence, we will resolutely remain focused on other challenges that we face around the world, starting with what we see as the most serious long-term challenge to that rules-based order, and that\u2019s the challenge posed by the People\u2019s Republic of China. I gave a talk on China last week. In it I said that China is the only country with both the intent to reshape the international order and increasingly the ability to do so economically, diplomatically, militarily, technologically. It\u2019s also an integral part, of course, of the global economy. It\u2019s critical to our ability to solve big global challenges, from COVID to climate. So you put all that together and that makes it for us the most consequential and complex relationship of any we have in the world. Simply put, we\u2019re going to have to be dealing with each other for years and years to come. The question is how most effectively to do that in terms of our interests and our values. One of the things that we believe strongly\u2014and this has been a debate and discussion going on for many years in Washington and in New York and in other places\u2014but where we now land is that we can\u2019t rely on Beijing to change its own trajectory. What we can do and what we\u2019re working to do is to shape the strategic environment around Beijing to advance our positive vision for an open and inclusive international system. As I described last week, summing it up, our plan is focused on three things: Invest, align, compete. Invest in ourselves, something we\u2019ve gotten away from over many decades. Align with our allies and partners, because our collective weight together has a much greater impact than any of our countries acting alone. When we\u2019re dealing with some action or conduct by China that we find objectionable, it\u2019s one thing when the United States takes it on alone as 20-25 percent of world GDP. It\u2019s another when we\u2019re aligned with partners and allies, and maybe it\u2019s 50 or 60 percent of world GDP. And then, finally, compete with China to defend our interests and build our vision for the future. At the same time, as we tried to make clear, we still see important areas of cooperation, and we\u2019ll pursue those wherever we can. Last piece is this. I\u2019ve got a really hackneyed acronym that my colleagues here at State are sick of hearing me say, and it\u2019s ROW, \u201crow,\u201d rest of world. Beyond China, beyond the crisis in Ukraine, we\u2019re determined to row, to keep the focus on the rest of the world, to make sure that American diplomacy is engaged in trying to make things just a little bit better, a little bit more peaceful, a little bit more hopeful, a little bit more prosperous, a little safer for our own citizens. So whether it\u2019s COVID, whether it\u2019s climate, whether it\u2019s dealing with crises and conflict from Ethiopia to Yemen, we\u2019re engaged. We\u2019re doing that. That\u2019s what our diplomacy is all about. And that\u2019s what President Biden asked us to do. He wanted to make sure that, even as we reasserted our engagement in the world, that we led with our diplomacy. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do. So let me stop there. And Dan, back over to you. KURTZ-PHELAN: Great. Well, thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your kind words about the magazine. And we\u2019ll look forward to getting your byline back in it at some point when you have time. Let me start with Ukraine, and especially the question of how we define success in U.S. policy. And I mean that in two regards. First, on the ground, you know, the clear and insistent message from the administration is, as the president put it in his op-ed yesterday, nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine. Does that mean if the Ukrainians are ready to keep fighting, do we go back to February 23 lines, the United States is prepared to keep up our support militarily and economically until they have achieved what they want to achieve on the battlefield? Or if they say we want to go back to 2013 lines, even with regards to Crimea, will we continue that support? And then, second, with regard to Russia, you talked about the ways in which Russia has been weakened. The administration has talked about the need to deliver Russia strategic defeat. Can you say more about what that looks like? How would a successful scenario from the U.S. perspective\u2014will Russia and Russian power look after this war from the way it looked at the beginning? BLINKEN: Sure. And those are\u2014I think those are great bookend questions because they, in fact, go together. A few things. First, when it comes to Ukraine, from my perspective, we cannot and will not be less Ukrainian than the Ukrainians. We\u2019re also not going to be more Ukrainian than the Ukrainians. And fundamentally, where this ends up really needs to be a decision by the Ukrainians, a decision that we\u2019ll support. But broadly speaking\u2014and this goes to the second part of your question\u2014here\u2019s what we see as principles to guide us as we\u2019re working through this. First, whatever happens, we want to make sure that we end up with a Ukraine that is independent, sovereign, and has the capacity to defend itself and ideally deter any future aggressions from Russia or from anyone else. That\u2019s one. Second, Russia should have a lesser ability to repeat this exercise in the future. So some of the measures that we\u2019ve taken, including the export controls, which are having a significant impact and will have a growing impact on Russia\u2019s ability, for example, to modernize its defense sector, those will, as I say, have an impact over time and make it maybe a little less likely that Russia does this in the future, as well as Ukraine\u2019s ability to really have a strong deterrent, something that we can do something about going forward. Third, we want to make sure that our NATO alliance is doing what is necessary to shore up its own defense and deterrence. We\u2019ve made a very good start of that in recent months. We have a NATO summit coming up where we\u2019ll take additional steps forward. And finally, two other things. I think we want to make sure that we use this aggression as an opportunity also to help Europeans as they move away from decades-long dependence on Russia for energy. We\u2019re seeing that start in a very significant way, in ways we haven\u2019t seen before. We\u2019d like to see that continue, and we\u2019re taking steps to help. Finally, moving beyond Europe, it\u2019s important that China take the right lessons from this. And I think what China has seen thus far, at least, is countries coming together in unprecedented ways to make sure that we are supporting Ukraine in terms of providing it what it needs to defend itself, to deal with its economic situation, to deal with the humanitarian crisis, that we\u2019re exerting extraordinary pressure, unprecedented pressure, on Russia, and, as I said, that we\u2019re also making sure that our own defenses and deterrence are built up. China is looking at this very closely, very carefully. We want to make sure that it takes away the right lessons. But fundamentally, again, where this actually ends up tactically on the battlefield, where lines are drawn, we are looking to Ukraine to decide that. We will continue to support them to make sure that they have what they need to deal with Russian aggression now, and also that they have the strongest possible hand to play at a negotiating table if and when it emerges. I believe one eventually will. Most of these things end in some fashion diplomatically. I hope that that\u2019s sooner rather than later. Unfortunately, the signs we\u2019re seeing right now don\u2019t suggest that Russia is prepared to engage in a meaningful way in diplomacy. KURTZ-PHELAN: You mentioned the assistance package that the president announced yesterday. And one piece of that was multiple-launch rocket systems the Ukrainians have been pressing for publicly, and I presume privately as well, for some time. This was the latest instance of what seems to be an intense and careful effort by you and your colleagues to weigh, on the one hand, the risks of escalation between the United States and Russia and NATO and Russia, and, on the other hand, the need to give the Ukrainians what they say they need and what we assess they need to fight effectively on the battlefield. In the case of the rocket systems, Foreign Minister Lavrov had, of course, warned that this would be, quote, a serious step toward unacceptable escalation. That was a warning that the administration evidently discounted. But can you talk through a bit how you assess that process, how you make that calculation, and why in this case you, despite that warning from the Russians, decided that this was a step the United States should take? BLINKEN: First, as a matter of broad principle, our objective, of course, is to help the Ukrainians bring this aggression to an end, not to expand it, not to widen it, whether in Ukraine or beyond. President Biden has been clear about it from day one. Something else the president has been very clear about from day one, including directly with President Putin, and that is exactly what we would do in the event that Russia pursued the aggression that it was threatening and that we saw coming many, many months ago. And he had conversations with President Putin well before the aggression began, to just be very clear with him about what to do expect\u2014what to expect in terms of our support for Ukraine, including with security assistance, as well as economic and humanitarian assistance if that proved necessary, what to expect in terms of the massive consequences that would befall Russia if it pursued the aggression, what to expect in terms of NATO strengthening its own defenses. So we have not been hiding the ball on that. There, in a sense, have been no surprises. All of this was made clear to President Putin well in advance in an effort to deter him from proceeding with the aggression. Tragically, he went ahead anyway. And then, Dan, all along we have tried to make sure that what we are providing to the Ukrainians, as well as what others are providing, meet the moment, and that is the equipment we provide is what they need to deal with what Russia is actually doing. So, for example, what was provided to the Ukrainians in the initial stages of the aggression, particularly in defense of Kyiv, with things like Stingers and Javelins really answered the moment. And by the way, that\u2019s not something that started on February 24th or February 25th; it actually goes back to last Labor Day when the president did an initial drawdown package. Another very significant drawdown package, as we call them\u2014this is the release of articles that our Defense Department has at hand\u2014another very significant one at Christmas, so well before February 24th, and then, of course, since February 24th we\u2019re now on our eleventh package. But each of these is tailored to meet the moment. As the conflict has changed, as it\u2019s moved away from Kyiv because of the extraordinary courage of Ukrainians but armed with what they needed to push the Russians back\u2014as this has moved to the south and east the nature of the conflict has changed, and one of the things that is necessary, and we heard from the Ukrainians on this, was the need for some longer-range artillery because the Russians were now in a position where their supply lines were shorter because all of this is much closer to Russia, they controlled before February 24th a chunk of the Donbas, they could use that to position their forces and position their equipment, and then fire things at relatively long range at the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians had to have some way at getting back at that and not simply being under fire from the Russians, so the systems that are being provided now are designed to help them do that. But it was also important to us that we get assurances from Ukraine that this equipment would not be used to attack Russia in Russia, because, as I said at the start, we don\u2019t seek to escalate this conflict; we\u2019re trying to bring it to a close but bring it to a close in a way that defends the principles at stake and defends Ukraine\u2019s independence and sovereignty. So that\u2019s how we\u2019ve been looking at this. And, again, I think whatever the Russians say\u2014(laughs)\u2014we\u2019ve been very clear from the start about what we were going to do, and we\u2019re doing it. KURTZ-PHELAN: We could, of course, keep going on Ukraine all afternoon, but let me keep your ROW caution in mind and turn to a different subject. You mentioned the speech you gave on China last week and I\u2019d urge anyone who hasn\u2019t listened or read the speech to go and do so because it really is the most substantial statement of U.S. strategy on China that\u2019s been made in some months. But I want to focus on one dimension of our strategy and our policy. You stressed in that speech that we don\u2019t seek to block China from becoming strong, from becoming a major power, and yet, you also made clear that Beijing\u2019s vision of and approach to global order is not acceptable, from our perspective. The rejoinder from Chinese analysts and policymakers is that this is what they always hear from American officials that, you know, we welcome your strength but everything you do with that strength we find objectionable. So I\u2019m wondering if you can say a bit about what the appropriate role for a strong China is. You know, are there ways in which the rules-based order of the international system can and should change to accommodate that strength? What do you see a strong China doing? BLINKEN: So a few things on this. It really is worth repeating and reiterating: We are not seeking to block China. We\u2019re not seeking to keep China down. As I said in the speech, we\u2019re certainly not looking for conflict and we\u2019re not looking for a new cold war. But the profound difference is this: I believe China wants a world order, which is good because order is usually better than the alternative. But the profound difference is this: The order that we\u2019ve sought to build, very imperfectly, but that we sought to build is profoundly liberal in nature; the order that China seeks is illiberal. We disagree and it\u2019s as basic and fundamental as that. And so to the extent that China\u2019s taking steps that would undermine the liberal, in the broader sense of the term, nature of the order, we\u2019re going to oppose that. And again, we\u2019ve been clear about that; there\u2019s no secret to it.  On issue after issue, a China that is acting in a positive, productive way should be a major contributor to dealing with the problems that the world faces, from COVID to climate, nonproliferation. I could go down the list. And we will continue to seek its cooperation, its coordination on that. Just a week ago, ten days ago\u2014we had the presidency of the U.N. Security Council this past month, in May. We used it to focus on the growing global food insecurity crisis that we\u2019re dealing with, a product, as I said, of COVID, of climate, and now of conflict, because the Russian aggression in Ukraine is denying so much wheat and other grains to the world market, blockaded in Ukrainian ports by the Russians. We\u2019ve sought to work with China on that. In fact, we invited them to take part in the ministerial meeting that we had on the food crisis; regrettably, they chose not to join, but the door is open. China has a tremendous ability to use its power, its influence to productive ends, and again, we would welcome that. On COVID, it is vital going forward, even as we\u2019re trying to bring COVID to an end, that we build a stronger, more effective, more agile global health security system that includes better real-time exchange of information, access for experts, the ability to see some kind of pathogen emerging and to be able to do something about it. China could be a major player in that. I hope that it would be. So, you know\u2014and these and so many other issues\u2014obviously nonproliferation. When it comes to North Korea, when it comes to Iran, China has a major role to play.  But ultimately, Dan, this is what I come back to: We can\u2019t decide for China; we don\u2019t purport to do that. We can\u2019t compel it to do X, Y, or Z. It\u2019s going to make its own decisions. What we can do is shape the environment in which it makes those decisions, and that\u2019s what the strategy that we put forward is all about, particularly when it comes to aligning with allies and partners, and there, I have to say, we have seen in the fifteen months or so that we\u2019ve been in office, a growing convergence in attitudes toward China, toward the challenge that it represents because some of the things that we\u2019re concerned about\u2014we\u2019re not unique. There are shared concerns, shared grievances, and the more we\u2019re able to, as we say, align with other countries in dealing with them, the more effective we\u2019re going to be because, again, if it\u2019s an economic matter, for example, if we are 20 or 25 percent of world GDP, well, that\u2019s one thing for China to have to contend with. If we\u2019re aligned with European partners, with Asian partners, it may be 50 or 60 percent of world GDP; that\u2019s a very different matter and something that China has to take seriously.  KURTZ-PHELAN: Let me go to one other ROW topic and that is Saudi Arabia and whether or not the president, in fact, goes later this month. As has been reported, there certainly have been, I think, a surprising degree of progress in the relationship, given the administration\u2019s statements about the crown prince and about the state of U.S.-Saudi relations early on after Inauguration Day. If the president does go, do you expect to see progress from Saudi on some of the human rights concerns that you expressed and the administration expressed early on? Do you expect to see certain steps taken to end the war in Yemen as a part of that trip, or is the need to open the oil spigots and the possibility of steps towards normalization with Israel sufficient reason enough for the president to go? BLINKEN: Dan, when we came in, President Biden was determined that we recalibrate the relationship with Saudi Arabia and to make sure that that relationship was serving our own interests as well as our values as we move forward, but also preserving it, because it also helps us accomplish many important things, which I\u2019ll come to in a second, and that\u2019s largely what we\u2019ve done. Of course, we had the murder of Mr. Khashoggi; that was something that we and so many others around the world took very, very seriously. One of the things that we did early on and that I did at the president\u2019s direction was, of course, to release our own report on his murder. I wouldn\u2019t underscore the\u2014I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the significance of that because having that report out, with the imprimatur of the United States government, I think has real meaning. At the same time, we initiated the so-called Khashoggi ban to make sure that any country that seeks to use tools of repression against people abroad who are criticizing, in one way or another, the government would pay a price for that, and we\u2019ve actually used it multiple times since.  At the same time, we thought it was very important to engage Saudi Arabia, to deal with people\u2019s lives going forward and to make sure that we were doing everything possible to help secure those lives.  Yemen was one of the most important places that we wanted to do that, and what we\u2019ve seen as a result of our work with Saudi Arabia as well as with the UAE and, of course, with the United Nations and some other countries is real progress in actually dealing with one of the worst conflicts the world has seen over the last decade. We helped achieve the first truce in eight years in Yemen just a couple of months ago. I\u2019m hopeful that that truce is now going to be extended. We\u2019ll see what happens over the next couple of days. But as a result of that, we have more humanitarian assistance moving to different parts of Yemen. We have, in effect, the guns, relatively, silenced, which means that people are not being killed and injured.  We have attacks against Saudi Arabia that have ceased, and, by the way, there are seventy thousand Americans in Saudi Arabia. So not only do we have a commitment to defend Saudi Arabia as a partner but we also have the interests of Americans to look out for, and we have the possibility, however fragile, of moving toward a more enduring peace in Yemen. Again, that\u2019s part of the recalibration of the relationship and we\u2019re\u2014applaud the work that Saudi Arabia has done to try to move this forward.  At the same time, we\u2019re engaging constantly, including me in my own conversations with my Saudi counterparts, on human rights in Saudi Arabia itself, including individual cases as well as more systemic issues. Saudi Arabia is a critical partner to us in dealing with extremism in the region, in dealing with the challenges posed by Iran and also, I hope, in continuing the process of building relationships between Israel and its neighbors, both near and further away, through the continuation, the expansion, of the Abraham Accords.  So all of that is critical and, yes, energy, of course, is a critical piece to this, too. We want to make sure that there is sufficient supplies of energy on global markets at a time when this is being increasingly challenged, and we want to make sure that prices are held in check so that consumers don\u2019t suffer, and Saudi Arabia is a critical player.  The point I\u2019m making in a long, long way is we want to make sure that through the relationship we are addressing the totality of our interests in that relationship and, yes, that goes to values and it goes to human rights and democracy. It also goes to other interests that we have that are necessary for the well-being of the American people.  We\u2019re trying to put all of that together and take a comprehensive approach to Saudi Arabia as we do with any other country. But I think you\u2019ve seen over the last fifteen months or so a more effective recalibration that is making sure that our interests are front and center. KURTZ-PHELAN: I\u2019m going to ask you a very quick, more personal question while Sam prepares questions from members and readers. You\u2019ve worked for at least two secretaries of state in the past. You\u2019ve observed many more in your various jobs over the last couple of decades. What has surprised you about being in the actual chair? What are the challenges that you did not anticipate or fully appreciate when you were a staffer?  BLINKEN: So, you know, when I first started working for President Biden when he was in the Senate and he was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Dan, I started with him back in 2002, and the job I held then was staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And when I started, someone told me very presciently, you know, there are two words in your title of staff director. Only one of them counts and it\u2019s not director.  So, you know, like anyone who\u2019s been in staff jobs for many, many years, making the transition in and of itself is kind of interesting. But I got to say it just gives you a greater appreciation for what those you\u2019ve worked for and worked with for many years have to engage in every day because, ultimately, in any institution the buck stops somewhere. In this institution at the State Department it stops with me.  There\u2019s a much bigger buck that stops at the desk of the president. But that\u2019s a responsibility that I feel, that I feel strongly, and that is much more acute by actually sitting in the chair for however long I\u2019m in it. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably the most important thing.  Now, having said that, I had one huge benefit coming into this job, which is I got to spend two years as John Kerry\u2019s deputy during the Obama administration, and so watching him, seeing how he did the job up close virtually every single day as well as, of course, having had the opportunity to work in different ways with Secretary Clinton, Secretary Albright, but also to be inspired by, to read about people like Jim Baker, like George Shultz and Colin Powell, who I considered a friend and a tremendous source of advice over many years.  All of that just made a huge difference. But, like anything, you can be familiar with something academically. You can be familiar with it by seeing it up close. It\u2019s always a little bit different when you\u2019re actually doing it.  KURTZ-PHELAN: OK. Well, I will resist the temptation to ask follow-up questions, and, Sam, let\u2019s go to some of the questions from folks on the line. OPERATOR: Thank you so much. (Gives queuing instructions.) Our first question is from Bonnie Glaser, who asks: Are you concerned about possible Chinese efforts to provide material support to the Russian economy, either legally or illegally, as Russia\u2019s economy weakens as a result of international sanctions?  BLINKEN: Bonnie, in short, the answer is yes and it\u2019s something that President Biden brought up directly with President Xi when they spoke by video conference a couple of months ago as the\u2014this was just when the Russian aggression started. We had warned our Chinese counterparts for some weeks that this was likely and, indeed, going to happen.  I think they were surprised, if not by Russia taking some actions, certainly, by the extent of that action, and one of the things that President Biden said to President Xi is we would look very unkindly at the prospect of China providing material support to Russia either on the military side or taking steps that, for example, undercut the sanctions that we would\u2014we were compelled to impose on Russia as a result of its aggression in Ukraine.  I have to say, thus far, we have not seen from China any systematic effort to help Russia evade sanctions nor have we seen any significant military support from China to Russia. On the other hand, the so-called no limits partnership that President Xi and President Putin signaled just weeks before the Russian aggression, we, certainly, see aspects of that continuing, particularly, China continuing to advance Russia\u2019s efforts politically and diplomatically, parroting some of the Russian propaganda, even amplifying it. I think that\u2019s deeply unfortunate and, ultimately, I think it really risks doing damage to China\u2019s reputation. China will have to make its own calculations about that.  One of the things that President Biden noted for President Xi when they spoke after the\u2014some weeks after the aggression was this remarkable exodus of companies from Russia as a result of the aggression, seven (hundred), eight hundred companies, the leading brands from around the world, who didn\u2019t want their reputations to be at risk by doing business in Russia, and, of course, doing business in Russia was also made more complicated by the sanctions. But the sanctions themselves didn\u2019t drive this exit. It was really companies deciding on their own that they were not going to do business as usual in a country that was committing this kind of aggression.  That\u2019s something, I think, that China also has to factor in as it thinks about its relationship with Russia, what support it does provide, as well as thinking about its own policies, going forward, in its more immediate neighborhood. KURTZ-PHELAN: Sam, let\u2019s go to the next question.  OPERATOR: Our next question is from Anthony Richter, who asks, this month the U.N. Security Council must decide whether to renew the travel ban on Taliban leadership. Given a steady stream of Taliban decisions negatively affecting the rights of Afghan women, how will the U.S. approach this critical vote?  BLINKEN: Thank you. So with the Taliban takeover a few things happened at the same time. One of those was a U.N. Security Council resolution setting out the expectations of the international community for the Taliban in Afghanistan.  Those included, among other things, an expectation that it would continue to provide for freedom of travel so that people if they so choose could leave the country, that it would not countenance terrorism emanating from Afghanistan and would take steps to deal with it, and that it would uphold the rights\u2014the basic rights of Afghans, including women and girls.  What we\u2019ve seen in recent months has been, I think, a serious reverse gear on women and girls in particular. We\u2019ve seen the lack of access to education for girls above the sixth grade. We\u2019ve seen various requirements, including the imposition of wearing a veil on women and then penalizing their husbands or fathers if they\u2014if they fail to do so. We\u2019ve seen other restrictions on their ability to get an education, to work, to engage in society, including for example even commentators on television. So all of this goes directly counter to the expectations of the international community that are in a U.N. Security Council resolution. They also go against the expectations of the community that were expressed in many statements that the United States helped initiate, including with over a hundred signatories on one of these statements at the time of the Taliban takeover. And what that says is that we\u2019ve been very clear with the Taliban that to the extent they seek to have more normal relations with any country, including the United States, we have expectations that they will live up to commitments that they themselves made as well as, as I said, the expectations expressed by the international community. So we\u2019ll see what happens in the\u2014in the next couple of weeks, but I think the international community writ large, the United States in particular, has been very clear about what we\u2019re looking for from the Taliban. And to the extent that they are not making good on those expectations and those commitments, that will have a real impact on the extent to which their relations with the rest of the world can be normalized in any way. KURTZ-PHELAN: As a follow up on that, have the escalating warnings or fears of a worsening humanitarian crisis and food crisis in Afghanistan changed our assessment of how to approach these questions at all? BLINKEN: Dan, I\u2019d say two things on that. First, even as we\u2019ve made clear what our expectations are\u2014and by the way, other expectations included access for humanitarian workers and humanitarian assistance, as well as a more inclusive and representative government\u2014two things on this. We believe that whatever the profound differences we have with the Taliban and however they are falling\u2014clearly falling short of the expectations that we\u2019ve set and others have set, it\u2019s hugely important that we do everything we can to make sure that humanitarian assistance gets to people in need in Afghanistan. We remain the leading provider of humanitarian assistance. We\u2019ve worked very hard to make sure that that assistance could get to where it\u2019s needed and that humanitarian organizations could function effectively in Afghanistan. They\u2019re in the lead in doing that, but we want to make sure that, to the extent we can support that, we are. That includes, for example, issuing multiple licenses just to make crystal clear to countries and institutions around the world that the sanctions that remain in place are not designed in any way to block the provision of humanitarian assistance. The second piece of this is broader, and it goes to the question of the relationship between what we\u2019re doing on humanitarian assistance and, more broadly, what can be done so that irrespective of anything else Afghanistan has a basically functioning economy so that people have a little bit of money in their pockets and can provide what they need for themselves. And whether it\u2019s a teacher, whether it\u2019s a humanitarian aid worker, whether it\u2019s a doctor, potentially whether it\u2019s even a civil servant, there has to be a basically functioning economy. And we\u2019ve been looking very hard at ways to do that that are not a direct benefit to the Taliban but that can bring benefits to the\u2014to the people, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re working on very actively. KURTZ-PHELAN: Sam, let\u2019s get in one more quick question. OPERATOR: Our last question is from Emerita Torres, who asks: Secretary Blinken, I believe your plan to modernize U.S. diplomacy is critical, including getting more Americans at home aware and involved in policy. How will the State Department\u2019s institutional structure and practices change to facilitate this effort? BLINKEN: Thank you. And I really appreciate the question because it is something of real, real focus for me, and that is the modernization agenda that we put out some months ago. And you know, the story with these things is often the same. Secretaries come and go. They all have reform plans. They all seek in one way or another to change the department. We tried to be inspired by a lot of work that had already been done\u2014and a lot of it has been done, including by the way by the Council in various reports\u2014about how to make this department more\u2014even more effective, more agile, more responsive to the needs of the American people, and more reflective of the country that we represent. We took those\u2014that work to heart. We spent a lot of time talking to our own people about those questions. And of course, we consulted with Congress because there\u2019s been a lot of good work done there over the years in thinking about how to strengthen the department. And all of that came together in a modernization agenda that time doesn\u2019t allow me to get into, but basically we\u2019re focused on a few core things. Instead of having ninety-seven priorities, we\u2019ve really just got a handful. One of those is making sure, for example, that our people have the tools in hand to do their jobs effectively in the 21 st  century. So we have a modernization agenda that goes to technology, but also goes to flexibility in the workplace. That, by the way, also makes sure that we can attract the best talent going forward because we\u2019re in a competition for that talent with other parts of government, with the private sector. We want to make sure that what we have on offer is going to bring people into the department. We\u2019ve focused our efforts, as well, on critical issues that have not necessarily been the things that the department has been known for in the past, but that are actually critical to the well-being of Americans going forward like climate, like global health, like economics, and of course like dealing in the cyber and digital world. We just stood up a new bureau for cybersecurity and digital policy. We got that done in record time with strong support from Congress. We\u2019re going to have a senior envoy in office to deal with emerging technology. At the same time, we\u2019re working on strengthening what we\u2014what we do on global health. And of course, we have John Kerry, who\u2019s been leading our efforts on climate. We\u2019re also building up everything that we do on economics because these are the things that are front and center that actually have an impact on American lives. And the department needs to be in a place where it\u2019s attracting talent in those areas\u2014again, areas that have not been necessarily right in the forefront of what we\u2019re known for and seen to be doing\u2014and that we generate talent, including in the way people are trained throughout their careers. And then, finally, let me say this: It\u2019s vitally important that we have a department that actually reflects the country that we represent. And this is not simply because and it is the right thing to do. It is certainly not an act of charity. It\u2019s fundamentally because it\u2019s the smart and necessary thing to do. We\u2019re operating in, to state the obvious, an extraordinarily diverse world, and the comparative advantage that we bring to the table is having one of if not the most diverse countries on Earth. The idea that we would not bring the fullness of that diversity into the work we do at the department makes no sense. It shortchanges us in the world. It shortchanges our foreign policy. The ability to bring these different perspective(s) and experiences to bear that may give unique insights into how a diverse world is operating and affecting our interests, it would be a huge mistake to leave that off the playing field. At the same time as we\u2019re grappling with problems, whatever they are, having that diversity of perspectives/opinion/experience, it\u2019s going to come up with a better solution. So we\u2019ve been engaged in a\u2014in a very significant effort to really and genuinely make sure we have a department that looks like\u2014looks like America. We appointed the first chief diversity and inclusion officer in the department\u2019s history. She and her team report directly to me. We have senior officials in every bureau responsible for this portfolio. We have a strategic plan that\u2019ll be\u2014that\u2019ll be coming out very shortly, a five-year plan on how to do this. And part of that is actually starting at the very beginning of the pipeline, reaching out and engaging with communities that are underrepresented in the department and kind of opening their eyes and minds to the prospect of serving in government and hopefully serving at the State Department. We now have, for the first time, paid internships. And that, in terms of the socioeconomic impact it\u2019ll have on broadening the aperture to bring people in at the outset of their careers to test out whether they might want to come here, that\u2019s going to have, I think, a significant impact. There\u2019s a lot to be said on this, but you know, I commend to those who are interested what we put out on the modernization agenda. But we\u2019re determined that, you know, by the time we\u2019re done here, we have a department that is even more responsive to the needs of the American people. Last thing I\u2019ll say is this: None of this is flipping a light switch. It is turning an aircraft carrier. It takes time, it takes sustained effort, and it\u2019s not going to be done in two years or three years. But my hope is that as we\u2019re doing these things we are helping the culture evolve in the department and we\u2019re also creating an ongoing demand signal from everyone here that will continue through the next administration and the administration beyond that. KURTZ-PHELAN: That is a great note to end on. Secretary Blinken, a huge thank you for joining us and helping us kick off what will be a series heading into the fall, and I will look forward to welcoming all of you back for subsequent events in the next few months. And again, Mr. Secretary, a huge thank you and best of luck in these intense months ahead. BLINKEN: Dan, thank you very much and I really was glad to be able to join everyone today. And let me just close by saying we continue to look to, to be inspired by, to rely on the pages of  Foreign Affairs . The number of times that, you know, I\u2019ve read something there that has sparked an idea, helped create an initiative, given me a good argument and very constructive criticism, I can\u2019t even count them. This is so vital to what we do. It\u2019s vital to our democracy. It\u2019s vital to our conduct of foreign policy. So all I can say is this: It\u2019s great to celebrate these hundred years, but even more important are the next one hundred years. And I\u2019m just grateful that we\u2019re all joined in this\u2014in this journey today. So thank you for everything you\u2019re doing. Thank you to everyone who contributes to  Foreign Affairs , to everyone who edits it, to everyone who reads it. KURTZ-PHELAN: We will hope to persuade you to create some more room on your bookshelves for future issues. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Thanks, all, for joining. Have a good afternoon.

events of January 6, 2021, seem no less momentous. Crucial to understanding whether that same threat of political violence persists today is knowing who participated, what motivated them to take part, and what has happened to them since. It will never be known exactly how many people took part in the assault, but as of mid-December, 727 people have been arrested for their actions that day. More than 150 of them have already pleaded guilty. The bulk of the rioters arrested have no documented prior ties to traditional extremist ideologies or movements. Rather, they can be considered radicalized supporters of President Donald Trump, people who bought into a cult of personality surrounding the former president and accepted his conspiracy theories about the election. A substantial minority of the hundreds arrested did, however, have a prior history of right-wing extremism, ranging from far-right Proud Boys to white supremacists to QAnon conspiracy theorists. The largest extremist contingent involved in the attack was probably the militia movement, a right-wing, antigovernment coalition that emerged in the early 1990s after a number of high-profile standoffs with the federal government. Dozens of militia adherents\u2014including Three Percenters and Oath Keepers ,  both prominent elements within the movement\u2014 traveled to Washington, D.C., last January. The Oath Keepers, an organization founded in 2009 to spread militia movement ideology to current and former police, military, and first responders, was particularly prominent. Over 20 Oath Keepers alone have been indicted for their actions on January 6, as have several associates who were not formal members. Moreover, many of the Oath Keepers have been charged with some of the most serious felony violations stemming from that day\u2014including conspiracy, meaning they coordinated their actions to try to disrupt the certification of the 2020 election results by Congress. In the aftermath of January 6, the militia movement has suffered a number of setbacks, ranging from deplatforming to increased law enforcement attention. Still, the militia movement continues to pose a dangerous threat, especially as antigovernment sentiment is less complicated for these groups now that a Democrat is once again in the White House.  LONG IN THE MAKING  Given its antigovernment ideology, the militia movement\u2019s participation in the storming of the Capitol was not surprising; one might even wonder why something like it had never happened before. The militia movement emerged around 1993 filled with hostility toward the federal government. It was a reaction to the election of Bill Clinton after 12 years of Republican presidents, to federal gun control measures, and to deadly standoffs between the federal government and fringe figures in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992 and Waco, Texas, in 1993.  The ideology of the militia movement was based on the premise that most of the world was under the control of a tyrannical, globalist conspiracy\u2014what members called the \u201cNew World Order\u201d\u2014and that the U.S. government was collaborating with it to strip Americans of their guns and deliver them into its clutches. Flattering themselves as patriotic Americans in the mold of the Minutemen of the American Revolution, militia adherents claimed they had to take up arms to protect themselves from this dire fate. The militia movement was strong throughout the 1990s\u2014and responsible for a number of terrorist plots and violent incidents\u2014but precipitously declined by the following decade, deflated by years of numerous arrests; the nonevent of the Y2K \u201cmillennium bug,\u201d into which they had invested so much conspiratorial energy; and the natural life cycle of surges of extremist activity. Around 2008\u20139, however, the movement experienced a renaissance, buoyed by the candidacy and election of Barack Obama as well as the same wave of right-wing, antigovernment sentiment that created the Tea Party movement. This time,  social media  sites assisted its growth, including the spread of the Three Percenter concept, a simplified version of militia ideology that helped bring many new adherents to the movement and aided in the formation of numerous new groups. In 2009, the Oath Keepers formed, quickly becoming one of the largest groups in the militia movement, with a goal of spreading militia ideology to members of the military, the police, and first responders. Although fewer organized militia groups were formed than in the 1990s, the total number of militia adherents was probably larger, and militia criminal activity\u2014from illegal weapons possession to terrorist plots and acts\u2014again approached that of the previous decade.  The militia movement was still large in 2015, when Trump launched his presidential bid, and the bulk of the movement\u2014which previously had supported only third-party candidates or fringe GOP figures\u2014became enthusiastic  Trump supporters . Here was an antiestablishment outsider, a conspiracy theorist, and an anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim crusader. When Trump defied the polls and was elected president, the militias were ecstatic. FUEL TO THE FIRE That victory set the militia movement on the road to the Capitol in January 2021, but it was a circuitous route. Trump\u2019s win posed a quandary: the movement had derived much of its energy from its antipathy to the federal government, but now that government was led by Trump. In need of new enemies, some members focused on immigrants, while others targeted antifa , a loose affiliation of activists and groups that oppose white supremacy,  as the enemy du jour. The movement was essentially stagnant for most of the Trump presidency.  In early 2020, however, events allowed the movement to regain its mojo. High-profile mass shootings spurred many states to consider gun control measures, which prompted militia groups  to take  to the streets in protest . When the  COVID-19 pandemic  broke out, antigovernment extremists were among the first to defy officials\u2019 efforts to combat the spread of the virus. Militia groups stood at the forefront of the opposition to public health measures, refusing to comply with mask mandates and holding public protests decrying \u201cmedical martial law.\u201d Since the efforts to both restrict guns and control the  pandemic  were carried out primarily at the state level, militia adherents didn\u2019t need to come into conflict with Trump. They could substitute hostility to state government measures for their traditional animus toward the federal government.  The militia movement has struggled with the aftereffects of the Capitol assault. The summer of 2020 brought nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, and militia groups showed up at many of them. Ostensibly, they were there to protect businesses or monuments, but the real motive for many was to oppose the antifa activists they assumed would be there   and to stare down Black Lives Matter protesters\u2014who militia adherents typically thought were controlled by Marxists or the liberal billionaire George Soros.  By August, the election cycle had intensified, and campaign events brought the militia movement to the streets\u2014in some cases, even providing \u201csecurity\u201d for Trump-supporting candidates. Long before election night, Trump and his surrogates were promoting conspiracy theories about the election being rigged, a notion the militia movement accepted without hesitation.  It was no surprise, then, that many militia adherents participated in the storming of the Capitol\u2014and that some allegedly planned and coordinated their activities, according to January 6 conspiracy indictments. Their attempts to overthrow the election failed, thanks primarily to the efforts of the D.C. and Capitol Police, as well as a Congress shaken and momentarily united in the wake of the attack. Initially, many militia adherents\u2014both January 6 participants and onlookers\u2014were excited about the events of that day, but their excitement quickly turned to consternation as the storming of the Capitol was met with public outrage.  WOUNDED, BUT NOT FATALLY In the year since that failure, the militia movement has struggled with the aftereffects of the Capitol assault. The Oath Keepers in particular received more attention for their participation than any other group but the Proud Boys. Even before January 6, negative publicity over militia activities had already taken a toll on the ability of militia groups to operate. In June 2020, Facebook suddenly deplatformed the movement, removing hundreds of militia-related pages and groups. For years, Facebook had been the main online platform for the militia movement, which used it to recruit, propagandize, and organize and even to plot the occasional act of terrorism. Getting kicked off was a huge blow. Making matters worse, several other  platforms removed  varying degrees of militia-related content. Militia groups had to scramble to reestablish communications with their own members. The storming of the Capitol brought even more scrutiny to the militia movement. Not only were many militia adherents indicted, but others\u2014including the founder of the Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes\u2014were kept wondering if they would be next to face charges. The Oath Keepers and other militia adherents were also among those hit with civil actions related to January 6, including a  significant suit  filed by the attorney general of Washington, D.C., in December. Such a lawsuit has the potential to destroy the Oath Keepers as an organized group by driving it into bankruptcy. Although the movement benefited from January 6 in some ways\u2014 hacked Oath Keepers data , for example, suggest that the group\u2019s membership increased, at least in the short run\u2014for the most part, the militia movement has suffered. With President Joe Biden in office, it has been able to pivot back to its traditional, conspiratorial hostility toward the federal government. But the movement has not seen anything close to the bounce it experienced when Obama took office. Although it is too soon to know for sure, it is possible that the combination of deplatforming and the aftermath of January 6 prevented or at least delayed or weakened another serious militia surge.  Still, the militia movement remains dangerous. In October 2020, federal and state authorities in Michigan announced the arrest of 14 people associated with a militia group, the Wolverine Watchmen, on charges related to an alleged plot to kidnap Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who had led the state\u2019s efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19. Since the Capitol attack, there have been more militia-related arrests. In late January 2021, the FBI arrested Ian Benjamin Rogers on weapons and explosives charges related to an alleged plot to attack the Democratic Party\u2019s California state headquarters in Sacramento in a bid to keep Trump in office; in July, a second person, Jarrod Copeland, was also arrested for his involvement. In April, FBI agents arrested Seth Aaron Pendley, a participant in the Capitol attack, for a separate plot to attack Amazon data centers. Pendley, who has since pleaded guilty, hoped a government overreaction to such an attack would cause Americans to rise up against it. With law enforcement casting an interested eye on the movement, more such arrests are likely to happen in the future. At the same time, other armed, right-wing groups have emerged. These groups, such as United American Defense Force, FEC United, and others, are not directly tied to the militia movement and occupy a space that bridges the mainstream and extremist worlds. Such spaces can be conduits to extremism for people who join these groups only to find them insufficiently hardcore. In this way, they could serve as a source of recruits for the militia movement. Alternatively, the groups could themselves become more radical. The 2024 election cycle, which will gear up all too soon, has considerable potential to become a flashpoint that could agitate these new groups, as well as the groups of the militia movement itself. One can hope that successful prosecutions of militia-related January 6 cases\u2014and sentences strong enough to send a signal\u2014will deter some would-be extremists from taking up arms again. But it is more likely that law enforcement will need to stay vigilant against a threat whose danger was demonstrated so clearly one year ago.

this past August brought an end to a 20-year war. But as a series of recent investigations by  The New York Times  has underscored, it also marked the beginning of postmortems about what the United States did right and, in some cases, did wrong. Drawing on Pentagon documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, the  Times  revealed  that U.S. drone strikes killed an alarming number of civilians in Afghanistan\u2014likely hundreds more than the 188 the Defense Department has acknowledged killing in such strikes since 2018\u2014a pattern that appears to be consistent with U.S. operations in Iraq and Syria. Targeting decisions were sometimes marred by confirmation bias: Pentagon analysts saw what they expected to see, often identifying civilians rushing to help those hit by U.S. strikes as terrorists and striking them, as well. This reporting is an important first step toward accounting for the shortcomings of the drone war that Washington launched after 9/11, one that President Joe Biden\u2019s administration should build on as it concludes its own  review  of drone strikes outside conventional\u2014or declared\u2014war zones. \u00a0 But no accounting of the drone war would be complete without determining whether policies intended to reduce civilian casualties from U.S. strikes ever worked. To answer that question, we studied strike data from Pakistan, where the Pentagon and the CIA  reportedly  conducted nearly 400 strikes in the ten-year period before President Barack Obama\u2019s administration tightened its targeting requirements. In 2013, the administration officially shifted its standard from \u201creasonable certainty\u201d of zero civilian casualties to \u201cnear certainty.\u201d Our analysis shows that this policy change dramatically reduced civilian casualties in Pakistan without giving terrorists an appreciable advantage, suggesting that similarly stringent targeting standards might save innocent lives in theaters such as Iraq and Syria, too. IN PURSUIT OF PRECISION  According to the nonprofit Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which collects data from news reports, official statements, press releases, and other documents, U.S. drone strikes in  Afghanistan , Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen from 2002 to 2020 killed between 10,000 and 17,000 people. Between 800 and 1,750 of the dead are thought to have been civilians, the highest percentage of them in Pakistan. But these aggregated data mask differences in the rate of killing over time\u2014and in the criteria that different U.S. administrations used to balance the need to target suspected terrorists with the requirement to protect civilians.  The last year of President George W. Bush\u2019s administration saw a tenfold increase in strikes from the previous three years combined. The Obama administration accelerated this trend, conducting three times as many strikes in its first two years as the Bush administration conducted in its entire second term. The accompanying surge in civilian casualties, which amounted to three civilian deaths per strike in 2009, drew criticism from the  United Nations  and from watchdog groups such as  Amnesty International . It was against this backdrop that  Obama  adopted a set of more stringent requirements for U.S. strikes in undeclared theaters, including Pakistan. Critics have suggested that the policy achieved little. The legal  expert  Jameel Jaffer argued in his 2016 book,  The Drone Memos , that Obama\u2019s \u201cstricter limitations on drone strikes seems to have had an effect only at the margins.\u201d Such analysis is based on overall civilian casualty figures, however, rather than the rate of change in civilian deaths over time. It also does not look at the mechanisms through which Obama\u2019s near certainty standard may have affected results on the ground.  By 2017, moreover, the question of the effectiveness of Obama\u2019s policy appeared moot, since President Donald Trump returned to the more permissive reasonable certainty standard.   U.S. drone strikes have killed an alarming number of civilians in Afghanistan. Our  analysis  takes a different approach, focusing on the effect Obama\u2019s near certainty standard had on the rate of reported civilian casualties following U.S. drone strikes as well as the rate at which strikes hit their intended targets. Beginning in 2011, U.S. officials began debating more restrictive targeting guidelines, and Obama appears to have begun ratcheting up requirements for strike approvals in undeclared conflict zones\u2014namely, Pakistan. Unlike U.S.  strikes  in  Afghanistan  and Iraq, which continued under the more permissive reasonable certainty standard because they were often in defense of U.S. soldiers, strikes in Pakistan began to be conditioned on near certainty of no collateral damage. Obama\u2019s ultimate goal, senior officials responsible for drafting, implementing, and auditing the reform told us, was to encourage commanders and intelligence officials to conduct more precise strikes, which would also help rehabilitate the United States\u2019 image abroad following the public outcry over civilian deaths. Almost immediately after the administration began its policy deliberations in 2011, civilian casualties from U.S. strikes in Pakistan markedly decreased. On average, our analysis of strike  data  from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism reveals that the deliberations and subsequent policy shift resulted in a reduction of 12 civilian casualties per month or two civilian casualties per strike. In doing so, the policy increased the precision of U.S. strikes\u2014the proportion of casualties that were the intended targets of strikes\u2014to 95 percent in Pakistan. In other words, under Obama\u2019s policy, U.S. strikes in Pakistan approached near perfect accuracy.  Had Obama not changed the policy, we estimate that U.S. strikes in Pakistan would have resulted in several hundred more civilian deaths between 2011 and the end of his second term in 2017. The decline in civilian casualties is more than a statistical artifact: it followed a deliberate effort by the Obama administration to impose stricter targeting procedures, including delegating fewer strike decisions to commanders in the field who, according to  The New York Times ,   often misidentified combatants due to cognitive bias. Obama\u2019s policy was explicitly designed to inculcate a culture of \u201c effective and discriminate use of force \u201d to overcome such bias, which can result from battlefield pressures such as anxiety, fear, and the desire to protect friendly forces even if doing so means putting civilians at greater risk.  FALSE DILEMMA The case of Pakistan shows that a standard of near certainty for U.S. drone strikes can reduce civilian casualties. But such a stringent standard imposes tradeoffs. Moving targeting decisions up the chain of command can result in longer approval timelines for strikes. One policy analyst we interviewed cautioned that Obama\u2019s policy resulted in \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d to take out terrorists. But our  research  shows that instances in which time is truly of the essence are rare. The typical strike benefits from \u201cred teaming,\u201d a practice that involves bringing in an outside group of analysts and commanders to question the merits of a strike based on the full body of intelligence, taking into account any information gaps. The fact that there were no major terrorist attacks on U.S. soil during Obama\u2019s presidency suggests that his higher targeting threshold in Pakistan did not come at an appreciable cost to national security.   A tighter threshold for U.S drone strikes can reduce civilian casualties without emboldening the enemy. If a higher targeting threshold succeeded in reducing civilian casualties in Pakistan without endangering Americans, there is reason to believe that similar targeting adjustments could yield the same results in other countries where the  United States  is currently conducting drone strikes. One complicating factor is the presence of significant numbers of U.S. forces on the ground. In declared theaters of operation, strikes are often conducted in support or defense of U.S. soldiers. As a result,  critics  of the tighter targeting standards caution that these standards could expose U.S. soldiers to greater battlefield risks, since commanders could be restricted in their ability to use drone strikes for close air support. This tradeoff is less pronounced in undeclared theaters of operations, where there are fewer U.S. boots on the ground. Still, the  Biden  administration will have to strike the right balance between military necessity and protecting civilian lives in its ongoing review of the United States\u2019 drone program.\u00a0  Regardless of the specific theater of operations, limiting civilian casualties in war should be an end in itself, not just because the United States is bound to do so under  international law  but because civilian casualties are thought to make it easier for terrorists to recruit followers. Our analysis suggests that reducing civilian deaths from U.S. drone strikes doesn\u2019t have to come at the cost of effective counterterrorism. A tighter threshold for U.S drone strikes can reduce civilian casualties without emboldening the enemy. Please enable JavaScript for this site to function properly.

Print this article Send by email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Get a link Get Citation Request Reprint Permissions Eight years ago, it looked like the U.S. military was making progress in reducing the harm its operations caused to civilians. The counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan meant winning the hearts and minds of the population. Lessons from the Vietnam War about the strategic imperative to not kill civilians were ubiquitous in conversations with U.S. commanders. With civilian protection seen as critical to a successful mission, the U.S. military was taking steps in Afghanistan and Iraq to investigate civilian casualties, track the aftereffects of its operations, and compensate victims. \u201c These practices are not perfect, even today, but they represent marked improvements in the conduct of war,\u201d I wrote at the time for  Foreign Affairs . As an advocate for minimizing  war\u2019s unintended casualties, I had seen these incremental gains accumulate over a decade. The progress wasn\u2019t anywhere near adequate, but it was something. I even went to work as the first (and as yet only) senior adviser on human rights in the office of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Many of us  working on this issue  felt the United States was turning the corner and could truly become the standard-bearer for protecting civilians in war.  Even as I applauded the U.S. military\u2019s improvement, however, I worried these gains could prove temporary if not properly institutionalized. Painfully learned lessons were being applied on an ad hoc basis, and no one at the Pentagon was \u201c specifically responsible for monitoring civilian harm or figuring out ways to respond to it,\u201d I noted at the time. The U.S. military was at risk of letting its progress slip away.   In 2014, a year after I wrote my essay, a top-secret U.S. strike cell made up of special operations forces was created to go after Islamic State (also known as ISIS) targets in Syria. Over the course of five years, it struck many enemy positions. But a recent   New York Times  investigation  revealed that it also killed an untold number of civilians\u2014deaths that were never officially counted and have only recently been acknowledged by the Defense Department after intense media pressure. Military officials who worked with the task force told the  Times  that the group would often claim its actions were taken in self-defense to circumvent the rules meant to minimize civilian casualties.  The unearthing of these strikes in  Syria  came only months after the U.S. military admitted that a high-profile drone strike in Afghanistan last August killed ten civilians, including seven children\u2014and not a suspected terrorist, as the Pentagon first claimed. And in December, the  Times  released a trove of Defense Department  documents  that reveal careless targeting, years of civilian deaths, and little accountability in Washington. Together, these events underscore that the  U.S. military\u2019s  overall record on civilian harm is shameful.  Many of these newly revealed strikes appear to be violations of the laws of armed conflict; others represent possible war crimes.  Worse yet, many of the problems now coming to light are the same ones that Human Rights Watch, where I work now, and other groups have been documenting for years\u2014to little avail.  In November, U.S. Secretary of  Defense Lloyd Austin  said  the U.S. military \u201cmust work harder\u201d  to reduce civilian casualties . That pledge has been made before and it\u2019s no longer enough. For anyone to take seriously Austin\u2019s commitment to change, the U.S. military needs to finally address the systemic flaws\u2014problems the Defense Department itself has acknowledged in internal reviews\u2014and allow an independent review of the civilian harm caused by its operations.  I believed the Defense Department back in 2013 when it said protecting civilians was a priority. And when I worked side by side with so many good officers in the Joint Staff, I had hope that their deep belief in how hard the U.S. military tries to avoid killing civilians would make it true.\u00a0 But my trust has been shattered. More important, the credibility of the United States as a moral, lawful actor in armed conflict is in jeopardy.  MAKE NO MISTAKE Civilians will suffer in conflict. That\u2019s a given and should be a major factor for policymakers when considering whether to use force. Even strikes that take every precaution to avoid killing civilians can result in lost lives, lifelong injuries, and crippling damage to infrastructure such as homes and water supplies. The U.S. military says it abides by international laws that try to limit these harms, but its actual record shows a pattern of dubious adherence to those laws, repeated mistakes, evidence of recklessness, and outright violations of the law. Even if every single civilian death by U.S. strike were considered legal, the sheer number of them and the similarities between them would be major cause for concern.  The August strike in  Kabul  was a tragic, recent example of the sorts of flaws that lead to avoidable civilian deaths\u2014flaws well known to anyone who has been paying attention to civilian casualties over the last two decades. In the Kabul case, U.S. drone operators  tracked  a man named Zemari Ahmadi for eight hours, convinced that he was a terrorist. Days earlier, the ISIS affiliate in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-K, carried out a bomb attack at the Kabul airport, killing an estimated 170 Afghan civilians and 13 U.S. service members. The pressure was on the U.S. military to prevent more attacks. After conducting hours of surveillance, the U.S. military killed Ahmadi and the other civilians around him with a Hellfire missile. But Ahmadi was the wrong man, a humanitarian aid worker going about his ordinary business.  In the wake of the Kabul attack, the Pentagon did what it nearly always does when it is called out in the media for killing civilians. First it denied that civilians were killed, insisting that the strike was \u201crighteous\u201d and the target legitimate\u2014a suspected ISIS suicide bomber. Then, days later, in the face of damning evidence, it called the strike a \u201cmistake\u201d and opened a classified investigation. Finally, as has been the result of nearly every civilian casualty investigation for the last 20 years, the Pentagon found no officials or service members at fault and announced that no one would be held accountable.  Lieutenant General Sami Said, the inspector general of the U.S. Air Force,  called  the Kabul strike \u201cunique\u201d because of the conditions on the ground in August. It\u2019s true that Kabul was particularly tense after the ISIS-K airport bombing, but there is nothing unique about an edgy environment in theaters of war. The truth is that drone operators did what they have done so many times in the last two decades. They allowed themselves to be misled by what\u2019s known as confirmation bias\u2014the tendency to interpret information in a way that confirms one\u2019s prior beliefs. Fearing another attack by ISIS-K, they mistook water bottles for explosives and Ahmadi for a suicide bomber. The operators were thinking more about the threat and less about the available evidence contradicting the conclusion that Ahmadi was a threat\u2014for example, the fact that he had visited the office of a California-based U.S. humanitarian organization earlier that day.  It would be bad enough if this were an aberration. It isn\u2019t. Larry Lewis, a scientist who led or participated in every official U.S. study on civilian harm, conservatively  estimates  there\u2019s been at least one civilian casualty incident per week for over 20 years, since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. Nobody knows how many deaths these incidents caused; the U.S. government doesn\u2019t even know. What is known is that many civilians were needlessly killed by a military that publicly carries a banner of moral, legal, and operational superiority into every battle.  GETTING IT WRONG Confirmation bias isn\u2019t the only problem plaguing the system. Like many civilians killed by the U.S. military, Ahmadi had been misidentified as a legitimate target. That is, he was not the victim of a strike intended to kill someone else. The positive identification of valid military targets is one of the most critical functions of air strike teams since it leads to decisions about who lives and who dies. Yet such teams have misidentified civilians as legitimate targets in case after case after case. For example, a 2013  report  by Lewis described how the majority of civilian casualties caused by U.S. military actions from 2007 to 2012 were the result of misidentification. A 2018 Pentagon  study  I was part of also contained significant evidence that civilians were misidentified as targets and killed in the 2016 U.S. military campaign to retake Mosul, Iraq, from ISIS and again during the effort to push ISIS out of Raqqa, Syria in 2017.  Another documented flaw in U.S. operations is that  drone strikes  repeatedly miss the presence of civilian bystanders. Drone operators tend to zoom in when conducting surveillance on a possible target. Although this makes it easier to see the suspect, it also makes it more difficult to see what could be around that target, including civilians coming and going. Strike teams can mitigate this risk by zooming out to look for civilians before launching an attack. The team that carried out the strike in Kabul last August apparently did not do that, judging from a Defense Department  fact sheet  and  comments  from officials. Seven children just outside the frame were killed.  \u00a0 Bad communication during an operation can also lead to civilian deaths. That\u2019s because within a  drone  operation there is a ground team, a higher command team based elsewhere in the region, an imagery team often based in the United States, and a separate team taking the strike. They\u2019re not necessarily all speaking to each other. So, an imagery analyst trying to discern whether a person is male or female might relay their finding to the command center, but the command center may not share the finding with the trigger-puller or may misinterpret the finding when passing it on. There are ways to make this function better but the U.S. military hasn\u2019t done it. Said, the inspector general who conducted the Kabul strike investigation, indicated that members of the strike cell did not alert others on the team that they were about to launch the attack. The CIA also had eyes on the target in the Kabul strike and saw the children nearby but was not able to get the information to the drone operators in time. The reason why has not been made public.  The most common pattern in U.S. air strikes is how rarely anyone is held responsible for civilian deaths.  Repeated internal investigations have resulted in little punishment, perhaps in part because units are investigating themselves. If military personnel and civilian officials knew they might lose their jobs on account of mistakes that led to civilian deaths, they would take greater care to avoid future mistakes.  The U.S. military should also reform its justice system to ensure its independence from the chain of command\u2014and criminal liability should be on the table for those who intentionally kill civilians. These and other consequences should be brought to bear in the military coverup of some 70 civilian casualties recently uncovered by a  New York Times  investigation of a 2019 air strike in Baghuz,  Syria , carried out by the classified special operations unit, known as Task Force 9. The Pentagon is conducting an internal investigation of this incident, but it\u2019s magical thinking to expect any accountability.  TOP DOWN What\u2019s perhaps most galling about this pattern of civilian death is that U.S. forces have shown progress is possible when there is pressure from the top to improve. Military commanders and civilian defense leaders have grappled with these problems and have found solutions that save lives.  When leadership makes  protecting civilians a priority, subordinates take it seriously. In 2005, U.S. commanders in Iraq realized their forces were killing civilians at checkpoints at alarmingly high levels and brought the problem under control by 2006. In 2009, General Stanley McChrystal, the commander of international forces in Afghanistan, made changes to military tactics that  led to a 28 percent drop  in civilian casualties. Similarly, the average number of civilians killed in errant airstrikes in Afghanistan dropped  more than 40 percent  after a 2010 tactical directive, a document that provides guidance for troops on the ground, instructed that keeping civilians alive during U.S. military operations was a priority. In 2011, Lewis convinced the U.S. command in  Afghanistan  to analyze strike data and civilian harm to see if it could lower the risk to civilians. After doing the analysis, he sent the then-commander,  General David Petraeus, some suggestions on how to improve, which Petraeus implemented. Civilian deaths started to go back down. But these changes didn\u2019t last.  Over time, the solutions one commander found useful\u2014not just for saving lives but maintaining local support for U.S. military efforts\u2014were eschewed by his replacement. Guidance that once saved civilian lives was loosened to make way for some other priority. As this played out, the military forgot what it learned, or worse, didn\u2019t care enough to make improvements last. For example, in 2009, Admiral  Michael Mullen\u00a0created and led the Joint Staff civilian casualty working group, putting a much-needed spotlight on ways to reduce civilian deaths in Afghanistan. But after some progress, the Pentagon disbanded the group and any improvements were lost.  The same cycle of learning and forgetting happened in the White House, too. Progress made under President Barack Obama\u2014such as tightened rules about ensuring civilians weren\u2019t present before a strike\u2014were undone by his successor, President Donald Trump. Indeed, Trump\u2019s overall tone on this issue gave elements of the U.S. military the leeway they wanted to not be so careful about civilian harm. During his campaign for president, Trump promised to  \u201cbomb the shit\u201d out of ISIS and target their families, which is a violation of international law.  His first defense secretary, retired General James Mattis, told a meeting of U.S. counterterrorism partners that the president directed the U.S. military to \u201cannihilate ISIS.\u201d It\u2019s hard to believe that rhetoric didn\u2019t pave the way to care less about the civilian population in places where the U.S. military was fighting. WHERE THE BUCK STOPS  Austin\u2019s pledge to \u201cwork harder\u201d to limit civilian harm hasn\u2019t produced any tangible steps that give me hope. But the White House is ultimately responsible for setting the tone for how the United States engages in the world and how it fights wars. President Joe Biden has said nothing publicly about the Baghuz or Kabul strikes, although his press office says he supports a full investigation into what went wrong in Kabul. The president requested a review of U.S. counterterrorism policy early in his administration, but he has not yet tasked his defense secretary with fixing the pattern of civilian harm. Biden has not, for example, set up even that most ubiquitous of bureaucratic solutions\u2014an expert working group\u2014to review the past 20 years of civilian harm.  The Pentagon and the White House, over multiple administrations, have shown they cannot\u2014or will not\u2014fix these problems with solutions that stick. There is no other option than to look to Congress for leadership and accountability.  But before members of Congress can solve the problems, they need to understand them. They can start by reading the dozens of existing Defense Department studies on the topic. These reports all include recommendations that, had they been implemented, would have spared civilian lives.  Once members of Congress are armed with information, they should hold hearings on the subject. Congress will quickly learn that the Pentagon has no plan in place to curb civilian casualties. Members should ask senior officials for their civilian protection policy (there isn\u2019t one). Ask for their analysis of data on civilian deaths in the past 20 years (that analysis doesn\u2019t exist). Ask what actions have been taken in response to recommendations made over the years on how to prevent civilian harm (very few). Ask who oversees these efforts at the Pentagon and how many resources are devoted to solving the problem of civilian harm (a handful of people are working on civilian harm, none of whom see the issue as their main task, and only pennies on the dollar are dedicated to it, given the Pentagon budget). Ask how many victims\u2019 families have heard directly from the U.S. government (a couple dozen at most in recent years). Ask what the criteria are for holding anyone accountable in cases of mass civilian casualties (there aren\u2019t any). Order them to provide this information and set a prompt deadline. Congress should also remember that these questions only get at civilian casualties caused by the U.S. military and do not cover operations carried out by the CIA. Congress has failed to ask questions for a long time, but some members are paying attention now. Several committees are considering hearings. Thirty-nine representatives and 11 senators  signed a letter  to Biden, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), urging him to prioritize civilian protection in new counterterrorism policies. Several more members have privately sent letters to the administration.  In December, John Kirby, the Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesman,  blamed  the botched August strike in  Kabul  on \"a breakdown in process and execution in procedural events, not the result of negligence, not the result of misconduct, not the result of poor leadership.\u201d This is profoundly and precisely incorrect. The lack of due care is the very definition of negligence, and the lack of leadership and accountability are what allows it to occur again and again.  When  The New York Times  revealed the truth about who died in the disastrous Kabul strike last August, General Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command,  remarked  that \u201ccombat \u2026 is an inherently messy, imprecise, bloody business. And we would like for it to be antiseptic. We would like for it to be perfect. It often is just not going to reach those standards of excellence.\u201d  No one is expecting perfection (though, when it comes to deciding who dies, it\u2019s hoped for). But Americans do expect excellence from their armed forces and the civilian leaders whose job it is to oversee them\u2014and there is no reason that standard should not apply to the task of preventing needless civilian deaths.
